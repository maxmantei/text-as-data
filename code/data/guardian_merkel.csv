International pressure on Russia following the Salisbury nerve agent attack has been strongly ratcheted up, with Britain, the US, France and Germany jointly condemning an “assault on UK sovereignty”, as Washington boosted its own sanctions on Moscow.
With Russia still promising retaliation to the expulsion of 23 of its diplomats from the UK, Theresa May’s frantic telephone diplomacy in the wake of the attack seemed to have coalesced the UK’s allies into a united response.
The joint statement from May, Donald Trump, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel dispensed with any earlier equivocation to say there was “no plausible alternative explanation” for the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, other than Russian action.
It said the Salisbury attack came amid “a pattern of earlier irresponsible Russian behaviour”. This message was reinforced hours later as the US increased sanctions over Russian interference in the 2016 elections, and accused Russia of a cyber-attack against its energy grid and other infrastructure.
US officials said malware had been found in the operating systems of several organisations and companies in the US energy, nuclear, water and “critical manufacturing” sectors, with the attacks allegedly traced to Moscow.
The statement – described by Downing Street as the first time the leaders of the four nations had spoken together in such a way – marked a toughening of the rhetoric against Moscow, which continued to insist it had nothing to do with the attack.
The leaders said they “abhorred” the Salisbury incident, and the involvement of the Russian-made novichok “constitutes the first offensive use of a nerve agent in Europe since the second world war”.
“It is an assault on UK sovereignty and any such use by a state party is a clear violation of the chemical weapons convention and a breach of international law,” their statement said.
Nerve agents are not hard to make in principle, but in practice it takes specialised facilities and training to mix the substances safely. The raw materials themselves are inexpensive and generally not hard to obtain, but the lethality of the agents means they tend to be manufactured in dedicated labs. The main five nerve agents are tabun, which is the easiest to make, sarin, soman, GF and VX. The latter was used to kill Kim Jong-nam, the half-brother of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, at Kuala Lumpur airport last year. VX is particularly stable and can remain on clothing, furniture and the ground for a long time without proper decontamination.
All pure nerve agents are colourless organophosphorus liquids which, after they were discovered to be highly poisonous in the 1930s, became the dominant chemical weapons of the second world war. Once made, the substances are easy to disperse, highly toxic, and have rapid effects. Most are absorbed swiftly through the skin or inhaled, but they can also be added to food and drink.
The agents take their toll on the body by disrupting electrical signals throughout the nervous system and the effects are fast and dramatic. Victims find it increasingly hard to breathe. Their lungs produce more mucus which can make them cough and foam at the mouth. They sweat, their pupils constrict, and their eyes run. The effects on the digestive system trigger vomiting. Meanwhile the muscles convulse. Many of those affected will wet themselves and lose control of their bowels. At high doses, failure of the nerves and muscles of the respiratory system can kill before other symptoms have time to develop. There are antidotes for nerve agents, such as oxime and atropine, which are particularly effective against VX and sarin, but they should be given soon after exposure to be effective.
The UK had “thoroughly briefed its allies that it was highly likely that Russia was responsible for the attack”, the statement said, adding: “We share the UK assessment that there is no plausible alternative explanation, and note that Russia’s failure to address the legitimate request by the UK government further underlines its responsibility.”
The joint response followed calls between May and the three other leaders in the days since the attack. They included a talk with Macron on Thursday morning, a day after the French president’s spokesman had warned the UK against what he called “fantasy politics”, prompting concerns in No 10 that Macron might hold back on attributing blame.
After the statement was released, Trump told reporters: “It certainly looks like the Russians were behind it. Something that should never, ever happen, and we’re taking it very seriously, as I think are many others.”
May spent some of the Thursday visiting Salisbury, where she met DS Nick Bailey, who became seriously ill after going to the aid of Skripal and his daughter, Yulia.She did not meet the two Russian victims, who remain in a critical condition.
May said the four countries were “very clear in attributing this act to Russia”. The statement showed that “allies are standing alongside us and saying this is part of a pattern of activity that we have seen from Russia,” she said.
Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, used a speech in Bristol to accuse Russia of “ripping up the international rulebook” through actions aimed at subverting other countries. The Salisbury attack was “atrocious and outrageous,” Williamson said.
Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, said the evidence against Russia was “overwhelming”. He told the BBC: “There is something in the kind of smug, sarcastic response that we’ve heard that indicates their fundamental guilt. They want to simultaneously deny it, yet at the same time to glory in it.”
While Johnson reiterated Britain’s plan to not send any dignitaries to this summer’s World Cup in Russia, he said the England team should take part.
Johnson said the UK would provide samples of the nerve agent to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), based at The Hague, for more tests.
Johnson also drew a connection between the Salisbury attack and the Syrian civil war, pointing to the way Russia had repeatedly protected the Assad regime from UN punishment over the Syrian government’s alleged use of chemical weapons. Successive UN inquiries found Assad’s troops had deployed chemical weapons, but the findings were vetoed by Russia.
Writing in the Washington Post, Johnson said: “The common thread that joins the poisonings in Salisbury with the annexation of Crimea, the cyber-attacks in Ukraine, the hacking of Germany’s parliament and Russian interference in foreign elections is the Kremlin’s reckless defiance of essential international rules.”
With Russia expected to expel UK diplomats as part of retaliatory counter-measures, Sergei Ryabkov, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, denied that novichok, the nerve agent identified as used in Salisbury, was of Russian origin.
Along with the cybersecurity alert, the US treasury announced new sanctions against Russian individuals and entities – including the FSB and GRU intelligence agencies – as well as the Internet Research Agency in St Petersburg.
As a result of Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election, US officials said that thousands of Russian-planted stories reached millions of people on the internet.
The new sanctions represent the broadest set of US punitive measures against Russia since the start of the Trump administration, and many of their targets are the same as those identified by an indictment by Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign."

Angela Merkel has returned to the German parliament’s governing benches to get to work on an in-tray overflowing with domestic and geopolitical problems after six months of fraught coalition building following September’s federal elections.
Having brought to an end the longest power hiatus in Germany’s postwar history, Merkel has to work with a diminished majority in her fourth term as chancellor to find solutions to immediate challenges, such as the threats from import tariffs from an unpredictable US president and calls for structural reforms to the eurozone’s financial system from France’s president, Emanuel Macron.
In addition, Merkel has to find long-term answers to the rise of the nationalist right, and a debate about growing social inequality in Germany’s booming economy.

Merkel was sworn into office on Wednesday afternoon after receiving 364 out of 709 votes in the first round of voting in parliament – nine more than required to gain an absolute majority, but also 35 fewer than if all the members of her next governing coalition had cast their ballot in her favour.
A look at the main priorities set out in in the German coalition agreement, which will guide policy-making for the next four years.
Europe
Efforts to reform the EU will top the incoming government's agenda as the bloc grapples with rising nationalism, security concerns and an unpredictable US ally in Donald Trump.
As well as agreeing to bolster EU foreign and defence policy, the parties say they are ready to raise Germany's contributions to the EU's budget once Britain leaves. They also support the creation of a European Monetary Fund, but offer only cautious backing for Emmanuel Macron's idea of a eurozone investment budget.
Immigration
Smarting from the backlash over Merkel's decision to open the country's doors to hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers in 2015, the government now aims to cap the annual intake of people seeking safe haven to about 200,000.
At the EU level, Merkel says she continues to expect member states to take in their allocated share of refugees. The chancellor has also reiterated the need to tackle ""the root causes of migration"" with development aid for the countries of origin, while better securing the bloc's outer borders.
Future-proofing economy
Europe's powerhouse economy is booming, with workers enjoying high wages and record-low unemployment, but that has done little to assuage concerns about globalisation and automation in the workplace, as well as growing inequality.
With its flush public coffers, Merkel's government aims to address these fears through investments in infrastructure, an offensive to improve the nation's creaking internet networks, pension reform and more funding for education and life-long learning.
As the chancellor received standing ovations, handshakes and bouquets of flowers from delegates across the political spectrum, she was watched by her 89-year-old mother, Herlind Kasner, seated on the Bundestag’s gallery next to Merkel’s husband, Joachim Sauer, and long-term adviser Beate Baumann.
“A clear vote and a smooth start. Now full steam ahead,” tweeted Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the new general secretary of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, which has formed another grand coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD).
Others were less impressed. Wolfgang Kubicki, the deputy leader of the FDP, said of the result of Wednesday’s vote: “That was closer than we expected. It shows that this grand coalition is actually going to be a small coalition.”
Merkel received supporting votes from 91% of delegates in her three-party coalition, compared with 92% in 2013 and 89% at the start of her first term in 2005.
Over the coming years, Merkel will have to find a way to win over unenthusiastic delegates not just among the Social Democrats, many of whom believe the party should have sought to reinvent itself in opposition, but also among the CDU, where there is disappointment over the loss of the finance ministry to the centre-left junior coalition partner.
One CDU politician described the result as a “bad omen” for the coming term. “This coalition has had a bad start, not just because of the unfortunate coalition deal, and won’t last for three and a half years”, said MP Alexander Mitsch.
After the vote, the chancellor travelled to Schloss Bellevue to receive a letter of appointment from the president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, before heading back to the Bundestag in order to take the oath of office. The new cabinet meets for the first time this afternoon.
The pressure will be on the new government to immediately get down to business, after months of horse-trading and delayed decision-making. Merkel said on Monday her government’s focus would be on integrating refugees as well as increasing state powers to extradite people who had no right of residence. She has also stressed the necessity of securing Germany’s borders and developing policies to mitigate the causes of migration.
The grand coalition was initially seen as an unlikely constellation after the election on 24 September, when Merkel’s conservative alliance, the pro-business Free Democrats and the environmentalist Greens tried to create a so-called “Jamaica” coalition. But after those talks collapsed, both the conservatives and the Social Democrats came under pressure to revive the grand coalition, which has governed Germany for the majority of Merkel’s time in office.
The reformation of the grand coalition means the far-right Alternative für Deutschland becomes the large opposition party in the Bundestag – a non-official role that nonetheless equips the rightwing populists with a number of formal privileges, such as chairing influential parliamentary committees.
On Wednesday, the party already gave a taster of the tactics it may employ to disrupt Merkel and her government over the coming years. One lawmaker, Petr Bystron, was fined €1,000 for tweeting a picture of his secret ballot with the caption “Not my chancellor”, while another was expelled from the visitors’ gallery for holding up a “Merkel has to go” banner.
Even without a noisy nationalist right, the new Bundestag is likely to hear a more robust tone from its members. The coalition deal between the CDU and SPD commits the government to a number of new debating formats, including a triannual Westminster-style “chancellor’s question time”, in which the head of the government has to field questions from the opposition.
When Steinmeier swore in Merkel as chancellor, he appeared to nod to the fact that her fourth term in power could yet prove to be her most challenging: “Let me give you my best wishes on your difficult path,” the former foreign minister said."

Germany’s new government has vowed to become a “grand coalition for the little people”, as Angela Merkel’s conservatives and her two coalition partners embark on a precarious project of reforming Europe while nodding to the language and concerns of the far-right.
Merkel, who is due to be sworn in for her fourth term as chancellor on Wednesday, almost six months after national elections last September, said on Monday that her new government would focus on “the integration of refugees, but also on the state’s ability to act when people have not been granted right of residence”.
“We have all enjoyed the benefits of the Schengen area, allowing us to move freely,” Merkel said at a joint press conference with her new vice-chancellor and finance minister, the Social Democrat (SPD) Olaf Scholz, and her interior minister, Horst Seehofer of the Bavarian-based Christian Social Union (CSU).
“But when we introduced free movement, we did not sufficiently think about securing our outer borders. That has to happen now, as well as a development policy that tackles the causes of migration,” she added.
On Sunday, Seehofer laid down his government’s law-and-order credentials by pushing for more video surveillance in public areas and faster deportations of rejected asylum seekers.
Wednesday’s swearing-in of the new government will put an official end to the longest period of coalition-building in Germany’s postwar history.
An aborted attempt to forge an unorthodox “Jamaica” coalition between Merkel’s CDU, the pro-business FDP and the Green party last November resulted in a revival of the “grand coalition” between centre-right and centre-left that has governed the country for the last four years, eventually approved by a vote of the SPD’s membership at the start of this month.
On Monday, Merkel nonetheless insisted that plans to present joint European initiatives with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in March remained on schedule, in spite of her ponderous path to power.
“I never said anything about a delay,” said Merkel, announcing that she would visit Paris shortly after her inauguration. “We certainly won’t have settled every last question, but we’ll be able to say more than in December. It surely would be too much to expect us to spell out every facet of the eurozone for the next 20 years.”
Merkel said the Franco-German tandem had been galvanised into action by the US president Donald Trump’s plans to introduce 25% tariffs on steel imports.
Referring to the threat of a pending trade war, Scholz said: “In an ever more complex world, it is absolutely necessary that Europeans stick together and develop solutions and methods to take control of shaping their future.”
Scholz, the SPD caretaker leader and a former mayor of Hamburg, signalled that his party would foster more combative relations with its coalition partner, remarking that “the fourth grand coalition in German history did not start out as a love match”. Merkel said she was looking forward to a “good debating culture” within her cabinet.
Both parties go into government on the back of historically poor election results last September, and the SPD’s polling figures have nosedived after its leadership made a U-turn on an announcement to seek renewal in opposition.
Yet Scholz can embark on his new ministerial portfolio with his party on a high after successive polls over the weekend appeared to reward the SPD for going into government. A survey on Sunday by the polling institute Insa saw the far-right Alternative für Deutschland drop into fourth place behind Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, the SPD and the Green party.
The new government will start with the same constellation of political parties but a reshuffled lineup of personnel. The CDU has ceded control of the finance ministry to the SPD and of the interior ministry to the CSU. Merkel and the defence minister, Ursula von der Leyen, will be the only politicians to retain the roles they held over the last four years."

Angela Merkel’s new coalition government is testament to her skill as the great survivor, and to the unwisdom of underestimating her ability to outmanoeuvre opponents. Alliances of Germany’s two main parties are dubbed “elephant coalitions”. The one agreed this morning lumbers into life on very different terms from the last GroKo (grand coalition). “Two tired elephants, dancing for the last time,” was the verdict of one speaker at the recent special conference of the Social Democratic party (SPD), calling for an end to deals with “the Merkelator” and her Christian Democrats.
In the end, she prevailed by a decent margin. There was a two-thirds majority among SPD members for remaining in the coalition, while a third backed a youth-led campaign to shake up left-of-centre politics.
Brexiteers' appeals to Merkel to break the logjam with EU negotiators have not worked
But the difficulty in delivering the coalition (five months since the election) marks a change that will resonate beyond Germany’s borders. It shows the renewed power of party grassroots, and the increasing influence of members over grandees.
For one thing, this deal placed Merkel’s fate squarely in the hands of SPD members (including 20,000 new sign-ups) – a move that has given voice to the left of the party. A two-thirds vote of support for GroKo is fine for Merkel – but much less so for the SPD, digesting poor election results and with a probable new leader, Andrea Nahles. She will need to apply pressure on the new government for a clearer leftish agenda – to prevent the one-third of disappointed SPD members from turning into a Corbyn-inspired movement for sweeping change.
Yet the greatest challenge to business-as-usual comes from another base: Merkel’s Christian Democrat party, from whose restless ranks her successor will emerge. The promotion to party secretary of Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, a flinty Christian Democrat from the Saarland in western Germany, marks a departure from years of Merkel-worship and redistributes power in the party from a close-knit pro-Merkel faction in Berlin.
“AKK” this week described dealings with Merkel as a “good, balanced relationship of trust and respect”. It’s a tone that cannily pays its dues to Merkel’s leadership, while putting Kramp-Karrenbauer herself at eye-level with the chancellor, and speaking for members – underlining that they have been taken for granted.
Kramp-Karrenbauer tartly observes that the party’s list of broad policy objectives has barely changed since 2007 – “the year the first iPhone was released”. Lines of dissent with the SPD lurk in her assertion that not enough has been done in Berlin to address the integration of the refugees the chancellor welcomed in large numbers in 2015. And she has pointed out, in language sharper than has been conventional on Team Merkel, that voters are “furious that people coming here for protection and aid have lied about their ages and countries of origin”.
If Merkel has previously swept aside unease on this issue, she must now deal more openly with anxieties about integration and the details of how to deal with irritations and fears that arise from it. She said last Monday that Germany had “no-go areas”, where police and public fear to tread. That frankness, if handled with good sense by the coalition, could keep at bay the far right, which has risen in part because conservative voters felt their concerns went unheard.
It may, in the short term, give Alternative for Germany (AfD) more “told-you-so” ammunition with which to make trouble in its new strengthened role in parliament. The Merkel-led coalition intends to head that off by capping annual refugee numbers at 220,000 (a concession for a chancellor who refused a cap in 2015).
Germany’s good fortune, however, is that a healthy budget surplus means there is money to deal with the difficulties. Its left wing will be happy to get more childcare, and curbs on short-term contracts. And for the right there will be some tax cuts and a more forthright acknowledgment of the difficulties of openness to refugees.
The most troublesome conundrum after all this is that it will be hard to convince the sizeable chunk of voters who drifted to parties of the far left, far right and the Greens last year that one more dance of Germany’s elephants represents a radical shift. The AfD in particular will gain more oxygen as the official opposition party.
For Europe (and Britain approaching Brexit), there will be little change. Merkel signals emphatically in private that she sees the French president, Emmanuel Macron, as sharing her worldview, and will use her remaining time to consolidate that link. Theresa May’s declared “trade-offs” will have to be approved, like it or not, by a renewed Franco-German duopoly. A weakened SPD makes the coalition even more avidly pro-EU. So the new alliance will move faster on European fiscal integration, and seek to edge towards a combined eurozone budget, though at a cautious pace.
None of this is easy listening for May. Her Brexit secretary, David Davis, has pre-emptively been seeking better relations with Team Macron – tacit acceptance by the cabinet’s Brexiteers that appealing to Merkel to break the logjam with EU negotiators has not worked. But it is still Germany, as the EU’s most successful economy, that will remain the biggest influence on what kind of Europe emerges from the continent’s recent convulsions. On that, Merkel is where she aims to be in her final stint at the helm – unchallenged."

Angela Merkel has secured her fourth term in power after Germany’s Social Democratic party (SPD) agreed to form another “grand coalition” government with the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
The SPD announcement ends almost six months of uncertainty in German politics, the longest the country has been without a government in its postwar history, and puts Europe’s largest economy in a position to answer the challenges for EU reform laid down by the French president, Emmanuel Macron.
Congratulating the SPD for its “clear result”, Merkel said she was looking forward to “further cooperation for the good of our country,” according to a tweet attributed to her on her CDU party’s account. Macron’s office welcomed the decision, saying “this is good news for Europe.”
But with both Merkel’s party and the SPD facing internal calls for a programmatic reboot and the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) now the biggest opposition party in parliament, the new government’s stability will likely be tested.
When the Social Democrat treasurer, Dietmar Nietan, announced on Sunday morning that a majority of SPD members had given the green light to a new “GroKo” or “grand coalition”, it was met with quiet relief rather than enthusiastic applause.
“We now have some clarity,” said the Social Democrats’ caretaker leader, Olaf Scholz, a contender for the role of finance minister, speaking at Willy Brandt House in Berlin, the party’s headquarters. “The SPD will enter into government.”
Only muffled cheers from behind the closed doors of the headquarters minutes earlier gave a hint of the weight of expectation that weeks of turmoil had piled on the centre-left party’s leadership.
A majority of 66.02% of 463,723 eligible SPD members voted in favour of renewing the constellation that has governed Germany for the last four years – a more decisive outcome than a narrow vote among delegates in January had indicated, but also a diminished achievement compared with the 76% who had endorsed a grand coalition four years ago.
In the wake of historically disappointing results at federal elections last September, the SPD leader, Martin Schulz, had initially ruled out joining Merkel in government.
But the collapse of talks to form an unorthodox “Jamaica” coalition between Merkel’s conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats and the Green party forced the German centre-left back to the negotiating table. With its back against the wall, the SPD managed to secure a surprising victory in getting the chancellor to cede control of the influential finance ministry.
A Young Socialists youth wing led by Kevin Kühnert, an energetic 28-year-old, nevertheless put together an effective campaign that encouraged members to reject the deal that the party’s senior leadership had agreed with Merkel’s CDU.
Europe’s oldest social democratic party needed to reinvent itself in opposition if it wanted to avoid the fate of the French socialists, the “No GroKo” camp argued.
Watching the announcement of the membership vote result on Sunday, Kühnert expressed his disappointment but indicated that he could continue to play an active role in the debate over the German left’s future.
“Disappointment undoubtedly prevails among many Young Socialists and myself,” he said, adding that the SPD now had to rise to the difficult challenge of renewing its identity while in government. “We will keep a close eye on the government – on both of its sides.”
Following the resignation of the failed candidate for chancellor Martin Schulz, the Social Democrats are likely to next month elect the former labour minister Andrea Nahles as the first female leader in its 155-year history.
A former leader of the Young Socialists who was once seen as a rising star on the party’s left wing, Nahles will try to reverse her party’s decline by establishing a more combative and confrontational approach with the CDU.
This week, the SPD will discuss the contenders for its six ministerial post, with the interim leader, Olaf Scholz, confirming on Sunday that his party will supply three female and three male ministers. Merkel is due to be officially sworn in as chancellor on 14 March.
Scholz, a liberal centrist and the mayor of Hamburg, is mooted to replace the CDU veteran Wolfgang Schäuble in the powerful finance ministry, where he will have to pay lip service to his predecessor’s dogma of a balanced budget while simultaneously meeting a commitment to increase Germany’s contributions to the EU budget, as outlined in the coalition deal.
“We don’t want to prescribe to other European states how they should develop,” Scholz said in a recent interview with Der Spiegel. “Mistakes have certainly been made in that regard in the past. And we need to ask ourselves how to deal with the consequences of Brexit.”
Merkel, meanwhile, has to juggle more immediate challenges on the international stage with a long-term task of arranging her successorship in a way that does not reverse a legacy of moving the CDU into the centre of the political spectrum.
The new party secretary, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, looks like the centrist candidate best equipped to moderate calls for a “conservative revolution” from the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), which will be in charge of the interior ministry, and the ambitious new health minister, Jens Spahn.
In the short run, the various political factions that make up Germany’s government will have to learn to pull together to face a looming twin threat to the country’s important car industry. Merkel will have to draw on all of the diplomatic know-how acquired in her 13 years in power to find a response to Donald Trump’s threat to tax Europe-made cars.
Closer to home, Merkel and her ministers also have find innovative ways to avert bans on diesel cars in highly polluted cities such as Stuttgart or Düsseldorf, rendered legal by a court ruling last week, which would affect millions of drivers.

When Dietmar Nietan, treasurer of the German Social Democrats, takes the stage at the party’s Berlin headquarters at 9am today, the world will be watching closely – but the thoughts of his fellow functionaries will already be wandering to the challenges of the weeks ahead.
If Nietan announces that members of Germany’s centre-left party have voted against a coalition with Angela Merkel’s conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the country will be plunged into political chaos and questions will arise over the future of a chancellor who can no longer organise political alliances.
If, as expected, Nietan reports a yes vote, it will end five months of political paralysis in Europe’s largest economy, but also pile pressure on the Social Democrats to reverse the party’s freefall in the polls and stop the erosion of one of the two central pillars of Germany’s postwar order.
Both of the SPD’s previous coalitions with Merkel as a senior partner have ended in the party recording historically poor results in national polls. This time around, senior members want to try a different, more aggressive formula. They hope to have found a suitably combative new figurehead in Andrea Nahles, a former leader of the Young Socialist youth wing. She has a leftwing slant, a reputation as a forceful orator, and once mocked Merkel by singing a version of the Pippi Longstocking theme song in the Bundestag.
Nahles, who is likely to take over leadership of Europe’s oldest social democratic party from Martin Schulz at a summit in April, faces the challenge of taking the fight to a conservative CDU that shares the government benches with her party colleagues.
A former labour minister, she is not expected to take up a role in the next cabinet, and would therefore have a freer rein to use her rhetorical skills in a parliament shaken by the arrival of the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), the first overtly nationalist party in the Bundestag for half a century.
While the AfD will become the biggest opposition party in the event of a grand coalition, the presence of the rightwing populists has also encouraged liberal and leftwing parties to up their game. Clips of verbal sparring acts are now going viral in a way that used to be rare in the staid world of German politics.
The SPD is already priming its first weapon for the fightback: last Friday the party submitted a draft law to scrap paragraph 219a of the German penal code, which currently criminalises the “advertising” of abortion services. The proposal is likely to be opposed by a CDU with strong Catholic support, and could see just the sort of public clash that Nahles needs to raise her profile.
But if the success of the German centre-left’s new strategy is up in the air, it’s because the challenge is nothing short of existential. Weeks of coalition talks have seen the AfD overtake the SPD to claim second place behind Merkel’s Christian Democrats in some polls.
The former Social Democrat finance minister Peer Steinbrück said last Friday: “Like the Socialists in France, the SPD is in danger of caring more about anti-discrimination and lifestyle issues than the concerns of the majority of the population.” Among its working-class base, the SPD is haemorrhaging votes to the far right. In the town of Cottbus, near the Polish border, the Social Democrats were the strongest force as recently as 2014. But tensions between locals and refugees have harmed the SPD more than the CDU: in a poll last week the party lost 17 percentage points, and the AfD came top with 29%.
“Every recent grand coalition has weakened the SPD and strengthened the far right”, said the Cologne-based film-maker and SPD member Steve Hudson, who led a campaign for a no vote. “The next one could end in the death of the Social Democratic party in Germany.”
Support for the centre-left among young and middle-class voters also seems to be draining away, either to leftwing Die Linke, which topped a recent poll for the 2021 Berlin state elections, or to the Green party, which is remaking itself under a new liberal-centrist leadership.
“The SPD’s problem is that it is no longer the strongest party in socially relevant circles,” said political scientist and SPD expert Gero Neugebauer. “It has ceded ground to Die Linke and the AfD among the workers, and is losing votes to the Greens amongst the bourgeoisie.
“They say they need to deal with the threat of the new right, but their problem is less the AfD than a lack of answers on the issues the AfD is thriving on. The SPD, like the whole of German politics, is still struggling to identify what the challenges of globalisation really are.”"

The Conservatives are not only struggling to agree on a Brexit vision for the future, they are losing their grip on the past. John Major tried in vain to jog memories on Wednesday, warning that the government’s disregard for economic and diplomatic reality had set the country on a trajectory towards calamity. To identify the danger was not “Project Fear”, he said, but “Project Know-Your-History”.
For this, the former prime minister was denounced by Tory MPs as an embittered hypocrite, propagandist and traitor. Politicians are not obliged to like their former leaders, but Conservatives might at least be expected to muster respect for the experience of previous generations. That is what conservatism is for.
But a scorched-earth ethos has captured the party. On the forced march from reality nothing of pro-European Conservative culture can be left standing. This is the spirit in which some Brexiters have taken to trashing the Good Friday agreement. By locking north and south of Ireland into mutually beneficial integration, the treaty impedes clinical severance of ties between the UK and the EU. So its success in underpinning peace for two decades must be rewritten as failure. In this view, history is not a record of events but an editable preface to whatever political expediency demands today.
An irony here is that recent Tory history and its lessons for Brexit are well understood on the other side of the Channel. European leaders have observed the gradual capture of a reasonable, mainstream party by the livid manias of its fringe.
One example: when David Cameron was competing for the Tory leadership in 2005, he needed a policy to shore up his Eurosceptic credentials. So he pledged to take the Conservatives out of the European People’s party (EPP), the main centre-right group in the European parliament. It was, in his eyes, a cost-free policy – potent as a symbolic rejection of European “federalism”; inconsequential in practice.
Merkel could see, as could any attentive witness, that no concession would ever placate the Eurosceptic ultras
Cameron honoured his commitment in 2009. Tory Eurosceptics were glad and few in Britain noticed or cared. One person who noticed and cared was Angela Merkel, whose Christian Democratic party is in the EPP. The German chancellor thought Cameron’s decision was potty, a wilful surrender of influence, a myopic flounce out of a forum for heavyweight leaders. The Tories instead cobbled together a club of angry nationalists and their influence in EU institutions declined accordingly. Merkel’s dismay was communicated privately to Cameron. She thought the decision marked him out as unserious. When he became prime minister the following year diplomatic efforts had to be made to persuade her that he wasn’t an idiot.
Over the following six years, Merkel watched Cameron being moved further and further away from the European mainstream. She could see, as could any attentive witness, that no concession would ever placate the Eurosceptic ultras and that, if continually indulged, they would not stop harrying their leader until they had destroyed him, which eventually they did.
Now the same Tory faction is harrying Theresa May. They were not satisfied with rebates or opt-outs when Britain was an EU member. They were not satisfied with Cameron’s renegotiation of that membership. And now they are not satisfied with any Brexit but the most extreme version. (If they get that, they will probably find cause to complain.) The hardline anti-EU ratchet keeps on turning and, just like her predecessor, May puts up no visible resistance. Merkel and her fellow European leaders recognise this process. There is an institutional memory in Brussels and, among officials, much fluency in the English language. European negotiators can read British newspapers.
The patterns of recent Tory history are familiar to May’s counterparts in the Brexit talks. They probably have a clearer-sighted understanding of them than she does. This matters because May’s pitch to the EU is that she can be trusted to uphold the values of the European project even while quitting its institutions. She offers “deep and special partnership” on matters of security and economic cooperation. She rejects the suggestion that Britain seeks to undercut its continental neighbours by dropping labour standards and environmental protections. She promises a post-Brexit partnership “based on high standards”. So May invites her EU counterparts to be generous and cooperative on the basis that she is an ally – aligned and equivalent in values if not exactly identical in regulations.
But even if the rest of the EU accept that May is sincere, they know she is weak. They know there is a section of the Tory party that is implacably hostile to the European project. That faction saw a regulatory bonfire as Brexit’s primary purpose. Some fantasised about a great unravelling of the union as a happy side-effect. That hostility is not a secret and the EU cannot ignore it. They have followed British history enough to know which side tends to win tugs of war between Tory leaders and Eurosceptic backbenchers. They knew where power lies in that party.
This is a problem for May beyond the technical challenge of negotiating post-Brexit trade. Assurances of good faith that the prime minister gives in Brussels are undermined by the record of ill-will in her party. The resilience and destructive capacity of that animus is well understood in Brussels. And if May needs reminding of the impact it has on Conservative leaders, she can always ask John Major.

Angela Merkel has moved closer to a fourth term as German chancellor after her CDU party voted overwhelmingly in favour of renewing a coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD).
At a special party conference in Berlin on Monday, Merkel also introduced her choice of new cabinet members, demonstrating a younger, more female team than at any time during 12 years in office. CDU delegates elected Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, tipped as Merkel’s successor, as CDU general secretary.
They also voted 975 to 27 in favour of a grand coalition deal that was shaped last month. Before the vote, Merkel had appealed to delegates to recognise the urgent need to “pave the way for a stable, capable government” five months on from the general election.
The party’s vote could be rendered null and void, however, should a postal vote of the SPD’s 464,000 members go against the deal. The results are scheduled to be announced on Sunday.
Merkel was given a five-minute standing ovation on Monday after a near hour-long speech in which she called for solidarity and new beginnings, and examined the reasons for the CDU’s worst general election results since 1949.
She sought to win back delegates’ support after threats of a rightwing rebellion within the party over her leadership, which many blame for the poor electoral performance. There has also been considerable disgruntlement that key posts such as finance minister will go to the SPD and interior minister to the CDU’s Bavarian sister party, the CSU.
Merkel surprised her critics by appointing Jens Spahn, one of her most outspoken critics, to her cabinet, having in the past seen off male rivals by sacking them. Her decision to bring Spahn, who at 37 is by far the youngest cabinet member, into the fold has been seen as a tactical move.
A conservative who has been withering in his attacks on Merkel for what he has called her “social democratisation” of the party, Spahn will run the health ministry, a tricky role because of the demands that will be placed on him to cut costs while keeping the powerful medical lobby on side.
Jens Spahn, who has been tipped as a future German leader, is currently one of Chancellor Angela Merkel's loudest critics within her own party.
The 37-year-old known as the ""anti-Merkel"" was this week tapped to become Germany's new health minister – a promotion widely seen as an attempt by Merkel to placate the conservative wing of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, which felt left behind as she charted an ever more centrist course in recent years.
Openly gay but staunchly conservative, Spahn is fiercely opposed to Merkel's open-door refugee policy, and has advocated a sharp conservative shift to coax back voters from the far-right AfD, which garnered nearly 13 percent in the September election.
He has called for a cap on migration, a burqa ban and has railed against imams in Germany funded by ""foreign actors"".

A commentary in the newspaper Mitteldeutsche Zeitung called Merkel’s decision to embrace her opponent her best opportunity to tame someone who has “repeatedly sought to saw at the legs of her throne”.
The leftwing newspaper TAZ asked whether her most dangerous opponent would succeed in his mission “end up as fish food in the shark pool”.
Other newcomers to Merkel’s cabinet include Julia Klöckner as agricultural minister and Anja Karliczek, an unknown politician, as education minister. Ursula von der Leyen and Monika Grütters retain their posts in defence and culture respectively. In a nod to those who have called for new blood in an effort to revive the CDU’s fortunes, the 63-year-old Merkel noted that she will be the oldest member of her government.
Helge Braun, who has a reputation as a loyal civil servant, is to become Merkel’s chief of staff, arguably the most influential post of all. He replaces Peter Altmaier, who will move to the economic affairs post.
Commentators have suggested that Merkel will increasingly take a back seat over the future direction of her party as she continues as chancellor for the next four year, though it is unclear whether she will see through a full term. There is an expectation that party factions might form around either Spahn or Kramp-Karrenbauer.
Spahn has made little secret of his ambitions to become chancellor and would like to return the party to its rightwing roots in an effort to claw back the more than million CDU voters lost to the anti-immigrant populist Alternative für Deutschland in the general election. Kramp-Karrenbauer has indicated that she wants to continue on Merkel’s central course."

Sunday 4 March will be a turning point for Europe. On the same day as an important general election in Italy we’ll find out whether an internal referendum of German Social Democrat party members has produced a yes for the grand coalition government in Berlin, continuing its current partnership with Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats.
Conventional wisdom says this would be a good result for Europe. I think the conventional wisdom is wrong. Like putting on a medical corset to alleviate a serious back condition then carrying on with your life just as before, a grand coalition would be good in the short term but bad in the long. You need to address the causes, not just the symptoms. And there is an alternative.
I spent two days in Berlin this week, and I’ve never encountered less enthusiasm for a prospective new government. This is supposed to be a wedding, but it feels like a funeral. That is also what it could prove to be: the funeral of the SPD, one of Europe’s oldest and most important parties of the centre left. In a shocking public opinion poll a few days ago, the far-right, nationalist-populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) scored 16%, half a point ahead of the Social Democrats. That may be a flash in the pan, but at 20.5%, the Social Democrats’ result in the last general election was already an all-time low.
We know from history that a grand coalition of the main centre-left and main centre-right parties tends to strengthen the extremes – and this has already happened. It was partly as a result of there having been this same grand coalition – or GroKo (for Grosse Koalition) – for eight of the previous 12 years that the AfD garnered the support of one in eight German voters in last September’s election. And remember that the AfD makes Ukip look moderate, and Silvio Berlusconi seem like a distinguished conservative gentleman.
A crucial part of the response to the wave of anti-liberal populism flooding across Europe must be a fundamental regeneration of the centre left. The French Socialists have virtually disappeared from view, and in the Italian election campaign Matteo Renzi’s Democratic party is doing almost as badly as the SPD. It is clearly impossible for the German Social Democrats to regenerate their party while locked in a joyless governing coalition with their main opponents. That is one reason why the Young Socialists, led by a man called Kevin Kühnert (named after the former English football star Kevin Keegan), are touring the country trying to persuade their older comrades to vote #NoGroKo.
Conventional wisdom says that after five months, Europe badly needs a stable German government, and that government needs to give a positive response to Emmanuel Macron’s ambitious European proposals. After all, the year leading up to the 2019 European elections is meant to be a crucial one to put wind in the sails of a post-Brexit European Union. This is why European council president Donald Tusk tweeted: “German GroKo is good news.”
The worst argument of all for a grand coalition is that there is no alternative
I am not persuaded that you need a German GroKo in order to have the essential European coalitions of the willing, or that a GroKo would be better for the European project in the longer term. Play out a mildly pessimistic but entirely plausible scenario. The German economy falters in a couple of years, and at the same time eurozone arrangements put in place by the grand coalition – responding to Macron at the insistence of the Social Democrats – result in Germany having to make financial transfers to a crisis-torn southern European state. Imagine the response among disgruntled German voters. Twenty per cent for the AfD?
The worst argument of all for a grand coalition is the one produced as a clincher in my Berlin conversations: there is no alternative. But the elite politics of Merkel’s now famous alternativlos, a new version of Margaret Thatcher’s Tina (There Is No Alternative), is precisely what voters are rebelling against when they choose the AfD, or Donald Trump, or Brexit. Imagine that you’re an unhappy German voter. You voted last September to change something. Then absolutely nothing changes: same chancellor, same coalition, same woolly rhetoric, very similar policies.
To be sure, new elections now, after five months of unprecedented political muddle, might produce an even larger protest vote for the AfD. But there is a better alternative, which the chancellor and federal president could agree to try if the Social Democrat party membership votes no: a Merkel-led Christian Democrat minority government. Minority government would be an innovation in the history of the Federal Republic. But it has been done in many other democracies, and there’s nothing in the German constitution that says you can’t do it. Indeed, the very strong position that constitution deliberately gives to the chancellor might make it easier to sustain a minority government. The mainstream opposition parties, Free Democrats and Greens as well as Social Democrats, would surely offer support on the main, consensual thrust of European or security policy, as well as budget and confidence votes. Yes, the minority government would lose some parliamentary votes on other issues, but as the German historian Heinrich-August Winkler points out, that would actually increase the importance of parliamentary debates and the work of select committees. Would that be bad for a parliamentary democracy? Quite the reverse.
Berlin’s response to Macron’s European proposals would be somewhat less enthusiastic, especially in relation to the eurozone. But that would be a realistic reflection of where most Germans are on this, which is a very long way from former SPD leader Martin Schulz’s vision of a United States of Europe by 2025. At the same time, the Christian Democrats might feel impelled to offer Macron more on a common foreign, security and defence policy – especially when faced with the terrible trio of Brexit, Trump and Putin. Would that be bad for Europe? Quite the reverse.
A minority government under Merkel probably would not last a full term, but that would also not be end of the world. I’m a great admirer of Merkel, but we are definitely approaching the time for a change at the top. That, too, is democracy. An election in 2019 or 2020 with sharper opposition parties, and with a new, younger leader of the Christian Democrats, would hardly be worse than one forced on a stale and crumbling grand coalition.
The motto silently hanging over the conventional wisdom of Berlin is a conservative one first used in 1957: Keine Experimente! (No experiments). But what Germany needs now is rather Willy Brandt’s cry from 1969, Mehr Demokratie wagen! (Risk more democracy!). The experiment of a minority government would create some uncertainties in the short term, but in the long run it would be better for Germany and for Europe.

The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, put forward close ally Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer on Monday to take over as secretary general of her Christian Democrats (CDU), heeding calls from within the party to inject new blood and groom a successor.
The decision to entrust Kramp-Karrenbauer, also known by her acronym AKK, with bolstering the CDU after it lost ground in an election last year, is significant as some party members are starting to look ahead to a post-Merkel era.
Sometimes dubbed “mini-Merkel” by German media, Kramp-Karrenbauer is highly regarded in her party for winning an election in her region last year that buoyed the CDU’s national standing before the 24 September federal vote.

Merkel, who was CDU secretary general before becoming chancellor, said Kramp-Karrenbauer, premier of the western state of Saarland, would bring “a lot of weight” to the role in what she called “difficult times, uncertain times”.
Kramp-Karrenbauer commands respect in the party for her serious, factual approach to policymaking. She impressed Merkel last month when, after a car crash, she continued work on coalition negotiations from her hospital bed.
The chancellor has been under pressure from within the CDU to bring fresh faces into senior positions and to begin planning for her own succession. By promoting Kramp-Karrenbauer she achieves both, and moves an ally into a key role.
“We have known each other a long time and can rely on each other, even if we have our own views,” Merkel, 63, told a news conference with Kramp-Karrenbauer, 55.
Asked if she saw Kramp-Karrenbauer as a possible successor, Merkel replied: “It is your privilege that you are always three laps ahead of others ... We have our hands full managing the business of the day.”
Though Merkel has said she is available as chancellor for four years, the succession debate has been supercharged by the inclusion of a clause in a coalition deal with the SPD that envisages a review of the next government’s progress after two years to assess whether any changes to its mission are needed.
Kramp-Karrenbauer is expected to be voted into her new role at a 26 February party congress. Her promotion is a setback to Jens Spahn, a 37-year-old arch-conservative long seen as a rising star in the CDU with an eye on the succession.
The outgoing secretary-general, Peter Tauber, is giving up the role after a period of illness.
By taking on the secretary general role, she will build up her network in the CDU, something she has had only limited ability to do as premier of Saarland, a state of just 1 million people that borders France. Merkel will remain CDU chairwoman.
Kramp-Karrenbauer said she had decided to step down as Saarland premier and take up her new job in “one of the most difficult political phases in the history of the German federal republic so far”.
Nearly five months after the national election, Germany is still without a federal government as the SPD consults its members before embarking on a re-run of their “grand coalition” with Merkel’s conservative bloc."

It should do the same in its Brexit strategy
A year ago, the annual Munich security conference – the most important gathering of international defence chiefs and ministers in the calendar – met to debate the proposition: “Post-truth, post-West, post-Order?” A year on, this weekend’s Munich conference has a new theme: “To the Brink – and Back?” The sense of relief implicit in the difference between the 2017 and the 2018 themes is unmistakeable and, to an extent, justifiable. The Trump administration has not, after all, trashed everything in the policymakers’ world, as it threatened to do 12 months ago. Explosions in relations with Iran, North Korea and even China have been averted, for now. Washington has not so far rolled over in the face of Russian aggression in eastern Europe. The so-called Islamic State has been pushed back, for the moment. The insurgent political tide that swept the US and the UK in 2016 has mostly been kept at bay elsewhere.
Yet while the worst may have been avoided, genuine positives are thin on the ground. Global confrontations continue and in some cases – the Middle East, for example – to deteriorate dangerously. The alliances that exist to control and resist them are still in shock at the Trump effect. Theresa May is in every context except Brexit a traditional multilateralist. She will certainly give a less thoroughly provocative speech at the Munich conference on Saturday than the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, did at the same venue 12 months ago, when he ludicrously described Brexit as a national “liberation”. Yet, viewed from elsewhere in Europe, Mrs May still leads a country that, by voting for Brexit, has made a serious contribution to the problem of instability, not one that is playing a reliable role in solving it.
Mrs May’s rhetorical answer is the mantra that Britain is leaving the European Union but not leaving Europe. Her visit to Angela Merkel in Berlin on Friday and her appearance at the Munich conference are designed to underpin that message and to make it a springboard for her Brexit strategy. Britain, Mrs May says, is fully committed to European cooperation, through Nato and in other ways, to deal with common threats to security. She will cite the fact that British troops are on the frontline against Russia in Estonia, that she has just pledged a new support role with France in the Sahel, that planned troop withdrawals from Germany are now being reexamined, and that the UK is a heavy-hitting and reliable partner in intelligence sharing and police coordination.
Security and intelligence have now been placed squarely in the vanguard of Mrs May’s political effort to persuade the rest of Europe that Britain remains a reliable and committed post-Brexit partner. The head of MI6, Alex Younger, appeared in Munich on Friday with his French and German counterparts to commit themselves to cross-border information sharing. His predecessor Sir John Sawers and the former GCHQ chief Robert Hannigan took to the media with a similar message. And the prime minister will cap this all off on Saturday in a speech that repeatedly urges closer cooperation with Europe and proposes a new UK-EU security treaty.
There are things to welcome here. After a grim two years of government negativity about the EU, it is a relief to hear the prime minister praising the union and being practical about it. Yet it is hard to see what EU partners are supposed to make of a prime minister who embraces the union at one moment then turns her back on it the rest of the time. The one thing that she could do to make her protestations more credible is to bolster it with a soft Brexit strategy. But this, disastrously, is the one thing she is terrified of doing."

Angela Merkel told Theresa May on Friday that she was “curious” about, but “not frustrated” with the British government’s slow progress in outlining its vision of the future relationship with the European Union.
Speaking in conciliatory terms as Britain’s prime minister prepares to present her ideas on security cooperation in Munich on Saturday, the German chancellor said that the two sides were seeking common ground.
“I want to say that I am not frustrated. I am curious how Great Britain imagines our relationship to be,” said Merkel at a joint press conference with May in Berlin, a nod to rumours that she had made fun of the British PM’s circular negotiation tactics at a Davos reception last month.
“Of course we have our vested interests – for example, as regards economic commitments we would like to preserve our partnership. Both sides are in a process of learning, finding out where there is common ground.”
“We have had a very candid exchange,” Merkel added. “We will need further exchanges, but frustration isn’t the right word.”
May, meanwhile, assured her German counterpart that she would start to outline her idea of a “comprehensive and ambitious partnership that is not based on an existing model” at the Munich security conference.
“It isn’t just a one-way street”, the British prime minister said. “I want a partnership with the European Union that is good for the main members of the European Union and Great Britain.”
As well as presenting the German chancellor with an outline of her proposals as to how Britain could continue its security cooperation with the European Union’s members after dropping to a third-country status, May said she and Merkel had discussed foreign policy matters affecting Ukraine, Syria, North Korea, and “Iran’s destabilising influence in the Middle East”.
May’s trip to Germany comes amid growing anxiety on the part of politicians and business leaders about the timetable for Britain’s departure from the European Union, with officials in Berlin concerned that the UK is backtracking on agreements made in December, rather than moving forward.
The view in German government circles is that Britain will need to iron out final details of the exit deal by October in order to meet its own deadlines to formally leave the European Union on 29 March 2019.
Merkel’s spokesperson said on Wednesday that the German government expected May “to make concrete its ideas” during her visit, while the head of the Association of German Industry (BDI) complained on Friday that the UK had “clearly completely lost track of time”.
“Instead of putting on the table concrete goals for the future relationship to the continent, the British government is delaying the process with unclear language,” said BDI director general Joachim Lang. “Soapbox speeches and unproductive debates only increase insecurity in the economy and raise doubts in Britain as a business hub.”"

Germany’s two largest parties are trying to improve the survival chances of the country’s next government by injecting their frontbenches with fresh blood before they formally enter a new “grand coalition”.
Outgoing Social Democrat leader Martin Schulz, who last Friday surprised many by abandoning his ambition to become foreign minister, is set to hand over the party leadership on Tuesday to 47-year-old Andrea Nahles – the second-youngest person and first-ever female head in the 155-year history of the German centre-left.
If Nahles, a former leader of the JuSos youth wing with a talent for powerful and at times brash political oratory, is installed at the helm of the SPD in a caretaker role, five out of six party groups in the German parliament will have female leaders.
Germany’s most prominent female politician, meanwhile, is herself under pressure to reshuffle her party’s ageing personnel in coming weeks. In a TV interview on Sunday evening Angela Merkel vowed to stay on as chancellor for the full four-year term and defended herself against criticism for conceding the influential finance ministry to the Social Democrats.
But Merkel also announced that she would confirm the names of new CDU ministers before a party summit on 26 February, and hinted that the provisional distribution of portfolios could be revised to pave a career path for her eventual successor.
“Of course the list will draw from party’s entire spectrum,” Merkel told public broadcaster ZDF in the interview. “That includes youth and experience. We don’t want to consider only the over-60s.”
Since reaching a coalition agreement with Schulz’s team last Wednesday, Merkel has faced increasingly vocal criticism from the ranks of a Christian Democratic Union previously famed for its message discipline.
Former deputy finance minister Jens Spahn, a leading figure on the rightwing of the CDU, who was not included in a leaked list of designated future ministers, told Austrian newspaper Die Presse am Sonntag that he knew “plenty of good people” who could take over when the Merkel era came to an end. “We don’t live in a monarchy where you can arrange your own successor,” the 37-year-old said. “When the time comes, candidates will have to assert themselves.”
CDU politician Roland Koch, a former premier for the state of Hesse, also appealed to Merkel to pave the way for a new generation of conservative politicians, naming Spahn and the more liberal-leaning Schleswig-Holstein state premier Daniel Günther as candidates.
In an interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, Koch openly questioned the longevity of the next government: “I don’t see or hear anyone voicing the hope that this coalition deal formulates a future-facing political agenda. It expresses the commonalities of two partners without a joint agenda.”
Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats managed to reach a coalition agreement after the chancellor’s attempt to forge an unorthodox “Jamaica” coalition with the pro-business Free Democrats and the Green party collapsed last December.
The coalition deal has yet to be approved by the SPD’s approximately 460,000 members, whose verdict will be announced on 4 March. After the Social Democrats’ worst result in the postwar era at last September’s national poll, many members believe that the party should reinvent itself in opposition rather than seek a new term in government as Merkel’s junior coalition partner.
There are also concerns that a renewed grand coalition could provide a further boost to the German far right, with rightwing populist party Alternative für Deutschland set to become the biggest opposition group in the next Bundestag.
Unlike Merkel’s party, senior figures in the SPD want to hold off any further debate about the next cabinet’s personnel until after their membership vote. “For now we want to convince the SPD’s members to vote in favour of accepting the coalition agreement,” said Hamburg’s mayor, Olaf Scholz, who has been mooted as a contender for the finance ministry post."

Angela Merkel has defended “painful” concessions she made to the Social Democrats (SPD) to win a fourth term as German chancellor and said criticism from conservatives was not a sign her authority was waning.
Asked whether she was planning to groom a successor to lead the Christian Democrats (CDU) in the next election, Merkel said she wanted a younger generation from her party to fill ministerial posts in a renewed coalition with the SPD.
In an interview with the ZDF public broadcaster, she commented on the rising displeasure among conservatives about her decision to give the SPD the powerful finance ministry. “I understand the disappointment,” said Merkel, who has led Germany for the past 12 years. “And now we need to show that we can start with a new team. We have six ministerial posts to fill and, from my point of view, we need to ensure that not only the over-60s are considered but also younger people.”
Merkel was weakened in a September election in which her conservative bloc bled support to a far-right party thrust into parliament for the first time by voters angry at her decision in 2015 to welcome more than a million immigrants.
In November, her efforts to form a government with two smaller parties failed, leaving the country in political deadlock and prompting some members of her CDU party to demand a succession plan.
Last week, she secured a deal with the SPD to renew a right-left alliance that has ruled Germany since 2013 after making painful concessions on Europe and fiscal policy as well as ceding the finance ministry.
The coalition agreement has been criticised by some conservatives who feel the next government will have an SPD-stamped agenda. The SPD’s 464,000 members have to ratify the four-year government programme in a postal ballot and the results will be announced on 4 March.
Merkel said that if they rejected the deal, Germany would probably hold a new general election. She rejected a suggestion that generous concessions to the SPD had weakened her position in the CDU, saying she had decided to cut a deal for the sake of Germany.
She sought to allay fears among conservatives that, by ceding the finance ministry, the next government would stray from the strict fiscal discipline enforced by the former finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble. “It was a very conscious decision at one point [during negotiations] to say ‘yes’ this works, even though I know and I myself felt it was painful,” Merkel said. “I want to say that the we [the conservatives] have also approved the policies [in the agreement] and the finance minister cannot simply do as he likes.”
Some conservatives are unhappy with her decision to allow the SPD to spend a record budget surplus and to embrace their demands for European reform.
The SPD has criticised the “forced austerity” inflicted by Schäuble on southern European countries such as Greece and had vowed in the election campaign to boost investment.
Social Democrat Olaf Scholz, who is expected to become finance minister, said on Saturday that Germany should not dictate economic policies to its eurozone partners and that mistakes had been made in the past. He said that the SPD supported sound finances and would preserve Schäuble’s balanced budget policy."

He has been described as the babyface politician who holds Angela Merkel’s future in his hands. Some describe him as a “kamikaze” social democrat; others the biggest political talent since Gerhard Schröder.
Kevin Kühnert, a 28-year-old student from Berlin who heads the youth wing of the Social Democrats, is the most talked-about politician in Germany. If he succeeds in his plan to scotch the idea of a Grand Coalition, the fragile construct agreed on last week by Merkel’s conservatives and the left-of-centre SPD, he will simply be the man who turned German politics upside down.
Although presented to the public last Wednesday more or less as a foregone conclusion, the Grand Coalition deal is far from done. Over the next few weeks, the drama surrounding Germany’s most drawn-out coalition talks is set to continue as the SPD’s 464,000 members are invited to vote on the so-called GroKo. Kühnert is the leading face of the #NoGroKo movement, on a mission to prevent what he thinks would be a disaster for both his party and for German democracy. If he succeeds he would make history and potentially bring Merkel’s 12-year reign as Europe’s longest-serving leader crashing down.
“I believe for the SPD to enter yet another coalition with the conservatives [having been in one for eight of the past 12 years] would be very dangerous,” he said in an exclusive interview a day after the putative deal was announced. Merkel ceded key ministry posts to the SPD – including finance, foreign and labour – following marathon talks, and members of the SPD leadership, including its then chief, Martin Schulz, were ecstatic. But not Kühnert, who had earlier tweeted he was “aghast” at the outcome.
“Of course, finance is an absolutely key post in any cabinet,” he said. “But, at the end of the day, the chancellor is still a Christian Democrat and no decision she doesn’t want will get past her or her ministers.”
He accused the SPD negotiators, including Schulz, and his successor as party leader, Andrea Nahles, of being “far too timid in their demands” and not pushing for any truly leftwing policies, such as reducing the taxes of the lower paid and increasing those of the rich. A finance minister, even if he were from the SPD, would fail to push through any of the party’s key principles, he argued. “At the end of the day, it’ll be a Social Democratic finance minister who will be responsible for the fact that the gap between the poor and rich in Germany is only going to get wider because the issue of taxes was barely discussed during the negotiations.”
Kühnert burst on to the political stage following the collapse of the so-called Jamaica coalition talks last month, when the Greens, pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and Merkel’s conservative CDU-CSU alliance abandoned the idea of forming a coalition. Initially determined that the party, having polled a historical low of 20.5%, could only find its place in opposition, Schulz about-turned and said the SPD was up for negotiations after all.
“We were adamant we didn’t have the mandate to go into government again,” Kühnert said. “Consider too that the coalition as a whole had lost 14% support. The SPD received a lot of recognition when we said we see our role in the next four years as being in opposition. Now I’m afraid that analysis appears to be passé, and I think that’s a huge mistake.”
He is also furious about a lot else when we meet, including the fact that Horst Seehofer of the Christian Social Union, sister party to Merkel’s Christian Democrats, and a staunch opponent to her controversial refugee policies, is set to become interior minister with greater responsibilities. Seehofer calls Hungary’s autocratic leader Viktor Orbán a “friend” and has invited him to speak at party events. “Such a person cannot possibly be the SPD’s political partner,” said Kühnert. “It’s a gruesome concept”. He would simply like to see his party renew itself in opposition.
Sitting in the party’s headquarters, surrounded by portraits of the SPD’s most famous leaders, including Helmut Schmidt and Willy Brandt, Kühnert is aware he is now considered a future leader of the SPD. He also carries an awareness of his party’s historical obligations – Otto Wels, the SPD leader who stood up to the Nazis in a speech to parliament in 1933, is among the portraits – which is why he believes the SPD should be sitting as the main opposition in the Bundestag, rather than the far-right Alternative für Deutschland.
“We have warned against leaving the opposition leadership to the AfD,” he said. “I believe the SPD, in particular, has a historical responsibility not to let that happen.” Last week the SPD saw itself slip down the poll rankings further to 17%, only marginally above the AfD’s 15%. “I fear it’ll only get worse,” Kühnert said.
Last month, at a special party conference in Bonn, at which around 600 SPD delegates narrowly voted in favour of proceeding with the GroKo talks, Kühnert gave a speech stating that anything the CDU and SPD once had in common had been exhausted. “If we were a pub, you might say the CDU is putting its beers on our tab,” he said, coining a phrase which has since been quoted everywhere.
Since the Bonn conference, 25,000 new members have joined the party to enable them to vote, most of them presumed to wish to call time on CDU relations. “We have been inundated with mails and tweets and messages of support from people wanting to help us out,” Kühnert said. “The rise in membership is phenomenal.”
He admits that he greeted Schulz, the former European parliament president, when he was voted the party leader a year ago with 100% support. “I was electrified by the thought that the SPD could become an independent political force again,” he said. That hope was dashed by the election results.
Now, rather than the Schulz Effekt, it is the Kühnert Effekt that everyone talks about. He agrees that, for a party seeking to redefine itself, the rise of Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour has been an inspiration, even more so the performance of Bernie Sanders in the US presidential race. “They have served to prove that social democracy is not a lost cause,” he said.
Regardless of what happens on 4 March, when the results of the postal vote will be announced, Kühnert’s star is unlikely to wane soon. Looking younger than his years, he has a penchant for black-hooded parkas and watching football and curling. A staple on chat shows, he cannot walk down the street without someone asking for a selfie with the man determined to say no to Merkel.
Kevin Kühnert is credited not only with putting the wind up Angela Merkel, but also with rehabilitating the name Kevin, which has a reputation in Germany of belonging to less able children and uncultivated parents.
His parents named him after footballer Kevin Keegan, who played for Hamburg SV between 1977 and 1980. Thousands of Germans have been named after him. But the real Kevin wave came a year after Kühnert’s birth, after the release of the 1990 US film Home Alone – in German Kevin: Allein zu Haus – in which Macaulay Culkin plays Kevin McCallister. Kevin Costner’s fame added to the hype in the 1990s.
A Berlin duo released the song Kevins: “You know things are on the up when we get our first chancellor called Kevin.”"

So Germany has almost got a new government. “Almost”, because a referendum among the members of the Social Democratic party (SPD) could still derail the Groko, the Grosse Koalition with chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian sister party, the CSU. And don’t bank on that not happening. Politics used to be top-down thing in Germany. Not any more.
Having said that, the Social Democrats would have to be stupid to refuse the deal. Consider this: in last September’s general election, they went down to historical defeat. As of writing, they are polling a risible 18% or so, not much more than the far-right newcomer Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).
Now you can argue that this is precisely because the SPD has been in government for so long – since 1998, with a break of only four years between 2009 and 2013 – and that a spell in opposition would do it good. And this is what the SPD’s youth organisation wants. They gaze with envy at Jeremy Corbyn’s populist appeal and dream of a rejuvenated party with a hard-left approach winning big in 2021 or 2025 and giving them lots of career opportunities, maybe in a coalition with the Greens and the radical Left party.
If I were a budding career politician in the SPD, I might think the same way. But for the present middle-aged leadership, four to eight years in opposition watching the rise of a new generation is hardly an attractive option. And there is no guarantee that moving to the left will do the SPD any good. That ground is already occupied by the Left party.
What’s more, the SPD’s soon to be ex-leader Martin Schulz has managed to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat (and from his own fit of pique on election night when he vowed that the party would go into opposition). The new coalition agreement has a decidedly social-democratic flavour. And the SPD gets the treasury, which Merkel’s tight-fisted henchman Wolfgang Schäuble used to scuttle ambitious plans in Germany and to throttle Europe in the name of financial discipline. They’re breaking out the champagne in the Élysée and the Berlaymont.
The loser in the poker game is Merkel. The only party that honestly wanted to govern with her were the Greens
Indeed, the loser in the poker game of the past weeks and months is Merkel. The only party that honestly wanted to govern with her were the Greens. The liberal Free Democrats (FDP) walked out of negotiations, and the SPD had to be enticed back with a deal that leaves Merkel’s own party without a single key ministry. Horst Seehofer, who is being forced out of his office as prime minister of Bavaria by his own party, the CSU, is being rewarded for his constant sniping at Merkel’s refugee policy with the thankless job of interior minister, where he can take responsibility for future terror attacks.
Everyone expects the chancellor to leave in the middle of her term and hand over to a successor. As the leader of a so-called Jamaica coalition between the Christian Democrats, the FDP and the Greens, she might have gained a new lease of life. As the leader of her third Groko, she looks tired. The concessions she has made to the SPD give superficial credence to the claims of the AfD that it is the only truly conservative force in the country and that it has stepped into the shoes abandoned by the CDU under Merkel.
This isn’t true. The populist AfD is anti-globalist, Eurosceptic and Russophile, all of which the CDU never was. But if the AfD can avoid further self-radicalisation, scandals and personal vendettas (which doesn’t seem likely), it might be able to break the current mould of German politics and form a coalition with a post-Merkel CDU/CSU, which is sure to tack to the right. Think the Austrian model: 2021 could see a revitalised right re-energising the moribund left, and a return to what the Germans call “Lagerpolitik”, the politics of opposing ideological camps. Not necessarily the worst thing that could happen, by the way.
For the moment, however, and assuming the SPD referendum doesn’t chuck a spanner in the works, it’s Merkel and the Groko. What does this mean for Europe and Britain? Martin Schulz will be foreign minister. As ex-president of the European parliament he is as Europhile as they come. Indeed, he recently proposed aiming for the “United States of Europe” by 2025. These are not empty words. Schulz is an idealist, and this is probably his last chance at real politics. Emmanuel Macron could not have a more fervent – and impatient – ally. So expect to see the euro area become more integrated, possibly with its own finance minister and minister for economic development. Expect more funds to assist the ailing economies in the south, maybe eurobonds or similar forms of debt mutualisation.
Given the resistance of the Visegrad group – Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic – to further European integration, Schulz could see himself faced with a serious European split within months of taking office. But don’t expect him to give up on his integrationist ideas or to soften his stance on Brexit.
He believes that restarting the German-French “motor” and reviving the eurozone will exert a pull on the peoples of the Visegrad states, who will, sooner or later, throw out their nationalist governments. And if not, he wants Brexit to prove to the pesky Hungarians, Poles, Slovaks and Czechs that leaving the EU is not a cosy option.
So, does the same old coalition mean more of the same old politics? I doubt it. Things are hotting up.

Angela Merkel has taken a crucial step towards ending a four-month period of political uncertainty by reaching a coalition agreement with the centre-left Social Democrats – but at the cost of giving the party a greater role in government.
Following a marathon of all-night dealmaking sessions and several missed deadlines, Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union on Wednesday agreed on the terms of a fresh deal with the SPD, whose supporters will now get a final say on the agreement through a membership vote.
But the prize of a renewed “grand coalition” is likely to come at the cost of ceding key ministries to her junior coalition partner, exposing the German chancellor to criticism from her own party.
The SPD leader, Martin Schulz, can be optimistic about rallying support for a new term in government after securing three influential trophy ministries. The draft coalition deal foresees the centre-left party filling the finance, foreign and labour ministries, as well as the roles for family, justice and the environment.
Schulz, who had ruled out playing a role in a Merkel government in the immediate aftermath of last year’s elections, is reportedly planning to hand his party leadership to the former labour minister Andrea Nahles and take charge of the foreign ministry himself.
The SPD mayor of Hamburg, Olaf Scholz, seen as a pragmatic centrist from the party’s liberal wing, is set to succeed the powerful Wolfgang Schäuble in the finance ministry, a key role for the future direction of the eurozone.
The draft coalition agreement hints at a departure from Schäuble’s hawkish focus on balanced budgets, promising a “solidaristic sharing of responsibilities” and a preparedness to increase German contributions to the EU budget.
At a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Merkel said that divvying up ministries had “not been easy” and acknowledged her party’s disgruntlement at the loss of the finance ministry.
“I’d wager that the SPD didn’t even believe it could get the finance ministry when the negotiations started,” the veteran CDU politician Wolfgang Bosbach told German media on Wednesday. “The CDU should have insisted on keeping the positions it already had.”
A boosted interior ministry with an additional focus on housing construction and life in regional areas has meanwhile reportedly been handed to Horst Seehofer of the Bavaria-based CSU, the Christian Democrats’ sister party – a consistent critic of Merkel’s policy course during the refugee crisis.
Such a constellation would leave Merkel’s own party with only the roles for the economy, defence, health, education and agriculture, and no truly high-profile ministries apart from her own chancellory.
Germany's new cabinet may be made up of the same parties as last year, but it is set to include a minister with a novel new mission: a leaked draft of the coalition deal sees Bavarian politician Horst Seehofer in charge of a ministry responsible for interior affairs, construction... and heimat.
A term without a direct equivalent in English, heimat can refer to one's homeland as well as a broader sense of a place with which one feels a spiritual affinity. Non-German speakers may recognise it from the title of Edgar Reitz's popular art-house soap opera.
Politicians In post-war Germany have traditionally avoided the term for its association with folklore kitsch – until 2013, when the Bavarian CSU set up a “heimat ministry” in Nuremberg, supervised by the state's finance minister.
The Bavarians' motive, it was believed, was to reclaim the language of national belonging from the rightwing populists – a move with limited success.
Bavaria's heimat ministry has so far mainly focused on extending broadband coverage in regional areas. Since Horst Seehofer set up his first heimat ministry, his CSU party has lost ten percentage points in the polls to the far-right AfD.
The coalition deal also complicates the question over who could eventually replace Merkel once she decides to step down. Two politicians recently mooted as potential successors, the young rightwinger Jens Spahn and the more liberal-leaning “mini-Merkel” Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, are not expected to play roles in the next government at all.
The CDU and the SPD have been in coalition talks since the first week of January after the collapse of Merkel’s attempt to form an unorthodox “Jamaica” coalition with the pro-business Free Democrats and the Green party.
Deadlocks over employment law and SPD-proposed reforms to the multi-payer health service resulted in the CDU and SPD missing several deadlines they had set themselves.
As the talks ran into Wednesday morning, the chancellor cancelled an official lunchtime meeting with Italy’s prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni.
Once the two parties have officially presented their coalition agreement, the SPD will allow their 460,000 members a vote on whether the party should formally enter a governing coalition with Merkel’s party.
Schulz, whose party has played junior partner to Merkel’s in the government for the past four years, initially ruled out the possibility of another grand coalition under his leadership.
The SPD’s leadership faces opposition from a number of groups, including its own youth wing, the Young Socialists, who believe it should reinvent itself in opposition rather than seek another term in government.
Only SPD members who joined the party before 6pm on Tuesday will be able to vote. At a special party summit in January, only a narrow majority of SPD delegates voted in favour of continuing coalition talks.
At the elections in September, the SPD plunged to its worst result since the second world war, winning just over 20%. And despite emerging as the strongest party, with 33%, the performance of Merkel’s CDU also disappointed supporters.
The Alternative für Deutschland’s role as the largest opposition party is a non-official one but it equips the party with a number of parliamentary privileges.
Migration emerged as a contentious political issue in Germany after 1.2 million people entered the country during the refugee crisis in 2015-16. The backlash against Merkel’s decision to keep open Germany’s borders resulted in a far-right party entering parliament for the first time in more than 50 years."

Since Brexit is the biggest problem facing the UK, it is easy from this side of the Channel to imagine it is also the greatest challenge facing the European Union. It is not. EU leaders have yet to find lasting fixes to structural weaknesses in the single currency. Continental politics is plagued by xenophobic nationalism, which is intimately connected to the absence of consensus on how to deal with mass migration from beyond Europe.
This has all been complicated by the absence of a government in Berlin since elections last year. So today’s announcement of a provisional “grand coalition” deal between Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats, led by Martin Schulz, amounts to progress. But the restoration of something close to business as usual in Berlin is cause for temporary relief, not celebration. The SPD membership can reject the deal. Collaboration with Mrs Merkel has bleached the German centre-left of its dynamism and identity. Mr Schulz was satirised in the election for the lack of a distinctive message. (He is standing down as party leader to become foreign minister.)
SPD blandness combined with the air of fatigue about Mrs Merkel’s 12-year incumbency as chancellor has allowed the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) to grow into a significant force. The AfD may now be the largest opposition party in the Bundestag, a situation that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago. A stale-looking coalition will be vulnerable to the charge that power has been sewn up by established elites against the interests of the people. Germany’s terrible history has served as cultural inoculation against extreme nationalism, but there is evidence that the immunity is wearing off.
The SPD membership could still reject coalition, hoping to find renewal in opposition. But at least in government the party will control the finance and foreign ministries – substantial prizes. Whether it has more impact than last time is uncertain. Mrs Merkel is practised in outmanoeuvring junior partners.
At the wider European level, the formation of a German administration should, in theory, unlock single currency and wider EU reforms. But there are competing accounts of what that requires in Brussels, Berlin and Paris. Mr Schulz also has a greater appetite for integration than Mrs Merkel. Meanwhile, the balance of European power could be upset by elections in Italy, the third largest eurozone economy, on 4 March. Rome is an unpredictable force in EU matters because its politics and finances are a mess. There is growth but not at a rate likely to reward the centre-left coalition of prime minister Paolo Gentiloni. Populists and ultra-nationalists are polling well. The campaign has involved relentless vilification of migrants. Italy’s position as the landing point for those crossing the Mediterranean has made the issue even more toxic there than elsewhere
Capitalising on discontent, Silvio Berlusconi, the 81-year-old media tycoon and convicted tax fraudster, has launched a comeback. His dodgy past legally excludes him from a return to the prime minister’s job, but he could still wield power in a coalition. It is a dispiriting prospect, not least because many European leaders have greeted his return to the scene with weary resignation, bordering on nostalgia. For all his flaws, his venal xenophobia is milder than the virulent strain across the Atlantic. It speaks volumes about the state of western democracies that the bounds of moderation are defined as marginally less obnoxious than Donald Trump.
Britain cannot avoid these problems by virtue of its decision to leave the EU. Europeans are still our neighbours, allies and principle trading partners. While each country’s domestic politics have unique difficulties, a common feature is a void where there should be simple, compelling reasons to reject nationalists. There are not enough bold policies and no electoral strategies to compete with the empty promises and cultural menaces of populism. That was the failure of Britain’s pro-Europeans over many years and a heavy price is being paid. Moderate politicians in the rest of the EU look no closer to a winning formula."

Germany’s anti-immigration, rightwing populist Alternative für Deutschland is preparing to play a noisy role inside the country’s next parliament, after a coalition deal between Angela Merkel’s CDU and the SPD was announced on Wednesday.
The renewed grand coalition – which is subject to a vote by the SPD membership – puts the two largest parties on to the government benches and makes the AfD, the third-placed party in September’s federal elections with 92 out of 631 Bundestag seats, the main opposition.
AfD leader Alexander Gauland was quick to lay into the coalition agreement on Wednesday, arguing that the negotiations had left Merkel’s conservatives an empty shell. “The CDU has given up as a party so that a Merkel without any real content can stay at the top thanks to Social Democrat support,” he said.
Germany’s system of proportional representation will not assign the AfD an official status as the leading opposition party, but parliamentary tradition decrees that it can lay claim to a number of privileges that other parties will struggle to deny it.
Whenever Merkel makes a statement in the Bundestag, the AfD will be the first party allowed to respond – a running order that is usually replicated in TV reports on parliamentary debates. On budget debates, the AfD will get to speak ahead of the government.
The first overtly nationalist party to enter the German parliament in half a century has already taken over a number of formal traditions usually handed to opposition leaders.
It has installed Peter Boehringer, an outspoken critic of eurozone rescues and the European Central Bank, as chair of the influential budget committee.
Through Boehringer, the AfD will be able to appoint like-minded civil servants to vacant secretarial positions and slow down the parliamentary process for policies of which it disapproves, but not gain any more voting power.
The budget committee has been chaired for the last three years by Gesine Lötzsch of leftwing Die Linke – not long ago a controversial party in its own right for its ties to the ruling party of communist East Germany, and for some, an indicator of the chairmanship’s limited political influence.
The AfD has also secured the chairmanship of two further parliamentary committees, for legal affairs and tourism.
Members of Germany’s established parties last June changed a rule allowing the oldest member of the Bundestag to kick off each new session with a speech, instead allowing the longest-serving MP to speak. This averted the privilege falling to controversial AfD politician Wilhelm von Gottberg, who has described the Holocaust as “a myth”.
During the four months in which Merkel has struggled to find coalition partners for a new government, the country’s upstart populists have slowly adjusted to working routines inside the Bundestag, filing a large number of parliamentary queries on issues centred around migration and leftwing extremism.
“The AfD tolerates Nazi slogans, gets caught up in internal fights and uses parliament as an agitprop stage,” leftwing daily taz commented in a recent op-ed. “But that doesn’t seem to affect their popularity. Apparently AfD voters want precisely that: a rightwing protest party.”"

Negotiators for Angela Merkel’s conservatives and the centre-left Social Democratic party (SPD) have said they are hopeful of presenting a coalition deal on Tuesday after their talks yielded an agreement on the country’s Europe policy.
The chancellor’s Christian Democrats (CDU) emerged as the strongest party in last September’s federal elections but have struggled over the last four months to find parties with whom to form a stable coalition government.
“We are on the final stretch but we’re not finished yet,” the CDU deputy leader, Julia Klöckner, told the broadcaster ARD. The two parties are still at loggerheads over labour policy and an SPD-driven reform of Germany’s multi-payer healthcare system, German media reported on Monday.
The two parties had agreed on Sunday on investing €4bn to boost the building of 1.5m new social and private homes by 2021, as well as setting aside €10bn to promote high-speed broadband expansion.
The SPD leader, Martin Schulz, announced on Monday that the two sides had also reached an agreement on the European chapter of the coalition agreement that amounted to “an urgently needed signal for a fresh start for Europe”.
The agreement would commit the next German government to “more investments, an investment budget for the eurozone, and an end to the austerity mantra”, as well as “fair taxation” of internet giants such as Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon, Schulz said via an information service for SPD party members.
As a next step, Schulz has to sell the coalition deal to the SPD’s approximately 450,000 party members, who will need to give a renewed “grand coalition” the green light via a membership vote.
The SPD’s leadership faces opposition from groups including its own youth wing, the Young Socialists, who believe it should reinvent itself in opposition rather than seek another term in government.
Only SPD members who join the party before 6pm on Tuesday will be able to cast a vote in the ballot. At a special party summit in January, only a narrow majority of SPD delegates voted in favour of continuing coalition talks.
Europe’s oldest social democratic party faces an uphill struggle in coming years irrespective of whether it helps form the next government. According to a new survey by the pollster Insa, only 17% of Germans plan to vote for it in fresh elections – a mere two percentage points more than those who would vote for the rightwing populist party Alternative für Deutschland."
"24";"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/29/vw-condemned-for-testing-diesel-fumes-on-humans-and-monkeys";2018-01-29;"VW condemned for testing diesel fumes on humans and monkeys";"Experiments involved monkeys and humans breathing in exhaust fumes for hours at a time
Volkswagen, the world’s biggest carmaker, is under fire globally from politicians and environmentalists following revelations it helped to fund experiments in which monkeys and humans breathed in car fumes for hours at a time.
Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said there was an urgent need for the company to reveal the true extent of the experiments, which were commissioned by the European Research Group of Environment and Health in the Transport Sector (EUGT), a body funded by Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW.
“These tests on monkeys or even on humans are not ethically justifiable in any shape or form,” her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said on Monday. “The indignation of many people is absolutely understandable.”
VW is already under heavy scrutiny over its role in the “dieselgate” scandal, in which the carmaker manipulated tests on about 11m cars worldwide to make it appear they met air emissions tests, when in reality they exceeded them many times over when used on the road.
The company said on Monday a small internal group had mistakenly pushed for the tests to be carried out and that they did not reflect VW’s ethos. But industry observers said VW’s excuses held little water, as the experiments had been well-documented and the results presented to managers at BMW, Daimler and VW, all of whom belonged to the EUGT, a car lobby group, which has since been disbanded.
VW’s supervisory board representative and chief controller, Hans Dieter Pötsch, said on Monday he was struggling to understand how the tests had been allowed to be carried out, calling them “in no way understandable”.
Daimler and BMW tried to distance themselves from the tests, stressing that none of their cars had been used in the experiments.
Initially reported in the New York Times, the tests, carried out in May 2015 by the New Mexico-based Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute (LRRI), involved locking 10 Java monkeys in small airtight chambers for four hours at a time. The animals were left to watch cartoons as they breathed in diesel fumes from a VW Beetle. The ultimate aim of the tests was to prove that the pollutant load of nitrogen oxide car emissions from diesel motors had measurably decreased, thanks to modern cleaning technology.
In a second round of tests, the animals were forced to breathe in the fumes of a Ford F-250 used for the purposes of comparison, because the car was an older model with apparently less sophisticated filter technology.
According to some reports in the Süddeutsche Zeitung and the broadcaster NDR, the monkeys were subsequently anaesthetised and intubated, so their blood could be examined for inflammatory markers. Their lungs were then washed out and their bronchial tubes examined.
According to the LRRI, the Java monkey species was chosen by the EUGT itself.
The Süddeutsche Zeitung reported the experiments were also carried out on 25 young and healthy human beings.
According to the Stuttgarter Zeitung, the experiments were carried out at an institute of the University Clinic Aachen and involved the group having to breathe in varying different concentrations of nitric oxide after which they were physically examined for any side-effects.
Revelations about the tests have only served to deepen suspicions that the industry is looking to increase the acceptance of diesel as a clean source of energy even as increasing numbers of scientific studies show the opposite to be the case.
LRRI said it decided to withdraw from the EUGT-commissioned study in the autumn of 2015 following the emergence of the dieselgate scandal. “After we learned about this fraud, we decided that the study was flawed,” the LRRI’s president Robert Rubin told a German newspaper.
Barbara Hendricks, the German environment minister, said what was known about the tests so far was “vile”.
“That a whole branch of industry has apparently tried to discard scientific facts with such brazen and dubious methods makes the entire thing even more horrific,” she said. Those responsible, she added “have not understood what is on the agenda here – to finally accept full responsibility in the diesel scandal”. She said she was “appalled” that scientists had “made themselves available as willing supporters of such despicable experiments”."

Merkel used a speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos to stress the need for multilateral answers to global problems on a day when Trump’s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, prompted fears of a tit-for-tat trade war between Washington and Beijing.
With Trump due to make his own speech to the forum on Friday, Merkel said: “Protectionism is not the proper answer. If we are of the opinion that things are simply not fair, then we have to seek multilateral answers, and not pursue a unilateral protectionist course where we isolate ourselves.”
Earlier this week the US put hefty tariffs on Chinese solar panels and washing machines, but Ross said more sanctions were in the pipeline. “We don’t think that adhering to the rules is protectionist,” he said. “We think, in fact, it is essential to having markets operate properly to have people play by the rules.”
Ross said his country had been badly treated by the protectionist policies of other countries in the past, adding: “The difference is that the US troops are now coming to the ramparts.”
Ross served notice that the US was looking at the aluminium market, saying: “You are aware of the actions taken yesterday. You are aware of the some of the actions that have preceded it. There will be more to come.”
He said he was not concerned about the possibility Beijing might respond. “Every time you take a trade action, there is the possibility of the other side taking a trade action in retaliation,” he said, noting that a tit-for-tat from Beijing might lead to a ratcheting up of the US response.
Ross’s comments in Davos came amid speculation that the US would pull out of its free trade deal with Mexico and Canada, the North American Free Trade Agreement, unless it secures better terms.
The head of the World Trade Organisation played down talk of a global trade war after the US said it was planning to take fresh action against Chinese imports.
Speaking to the Guardian, Roberto Azevêdo said countries were becoming more aware of the risks of a go-it-alone approach that would harm their poorest citizens the most.
The WTO’s director general said that a year ago the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting had been dominated by talk of Donald Trump’s protectionist policies leading to a trade war.
“We are here one year later without a trade war and I don’t think we have the makings of one yet,” Azevêdo added.

Azevêdo said that since 2008, only 5% of global trade had been affected by restrictive measures: “We didn’t see rampant protectionist pressures.”
Azevêdo said he expected the US president to maintain his tough approach to trade in his speech on Friday. “I wouldn’t expect him to change what he has been saying. He has had a very consistent approach towards international trade. He thinks the multilateral trading system has to be more responsive to economic reality and he would like to see reform.”
Azevêdo said every multilateral organisation, including the WTO, could be improved but echoed Merkel in warning against an isolationist approach, which he said would hurt poor people most.
He also said it would take time to untangle the UK from trade agreements the European Union has with other countries, especially the quotas governing imports into the single market.
The EU and UK want the quotas to be divided up after Brexit, but so far this has been resisted by other WTO members.
Azevêdo said he did not expect the status quo to be agreed without scrutiny, and predicted the process could take some time. “Every time they see the opportunity to negotiate, there is a tendency for negotiators to try to maximise the outcome. After the UK leaves the EU there will be new terms of contract. Other WTO members will say whether they accept them or not.”"

Germany has now been without a government for more than three months, and it could be at least the end of February before Angela Merkel can start her fourth term as chancellor – if she ever can. It is surely significant that two successive elections have each been followed by record-breaking difficulties in forming a government. It is a reminder that the once seemingly commanding large parties are dwindling in Germany, just as they have dwindled elsewhere in Europe. German party politics is fragmenting: there are now six different party groupings in the newly elected Bundestag or parliament.
Following the weekend vote by the social democrats (SPD) to begin detailed coalition talks with Angela Merkel’s centre-right CDU-CSU bloc, normal political business may now reassert itself to some degree. Nevertheless, there are still major hurdles to jump, of which the largest will be a referendum among SPD members on the deal, and success is not guaranteed. Even without serious hitches, it may be fully six months before a new government is finally formed in Europe’s richest and most important country. This may not do much to shake Germany’s economic credibility. But it is putting unfamiliar pressures on Germany’s party and governmental systems. The fact that Mrs Merkel has long been Europe’s dominant leader in spite of never having secured an overall majority should not disguise the importance of these new signs of weakness.
Nowhere is this weakness more obvious than in the SPD. Germany’s oldest party scored its worst election result in modern times in September, claiming only 20.5% of the vote. At the time, the party leader Martin Schulz spoke for many activists when he said the SPD needed to regroup and rethink in opposition, blaming the result on the SPD’s role as junior partner in Mrs Merkel’s 2013-17 grand coalition. But after the failure of her attempt in the autumn to form a three-way coalition with the liberal FDP and the environmentalist Greens, Mrs Merkel came knocking on the SPD’s door once more and talks resumed. Sunday’s party conference in Bonn forced social democrats to face a difficult dilemma: remain in Mrs Merkel’s shadow in another “Gro-Ko” grand coalition – or spurn a deal and risk fresh elections.
The result at the weekend showed the extent of the divide. When the vote was called, a show of hands was too close to call. On a count, Mr Schulz prevailed by 362 to 279 – just 56% support. Everything about the conference in Bonn was uneasy. Mr Schulz did his best to promote his framework deal with Mrs Merkel as delivering on SPD domestic priorities and as the embodiment of the SPD’s commitment to Europe. But the party’s youth section opposed him, while important regions like North Rhine Westphalia and Hessen demanded more from Mrs Merkel. As a result, Mr Schulz had to pitch his appeal as a call to enter negotiations, not necessarily to enter government, and he had to promise changes in the framework deal on more liberal immigration and tighter labour rules that Mrs Merkel may not concede.
The long gestation of Germany’s next government now moves on to detailed talks, to be followed by the referendum of the SPD’s 440,000 members on the outcome. There are many possibilities about how all this may end, one of which might involve another roll of the dice between Mrs Merkel and the Greens to form a minority government with tacit SPD support but not participation. However, the dilemmas facing the SPD were not resolved at the weekend. The deal that Mr Schultz has to negotiate will not only shape the future of his party, but of Germany too."

Angela Merkel has welcomed the Social Democrats’ decision to enter into formal coalition talks, even as the party’s leader signalled he would try to wring concessions from her before putting the final deal to members in a postal ballot.
“The path for coalition negotiations is now clear,” said the German chancellor, appearing relieved after the SPD’s vote on the issue on Sunday. She said she would strive to create an economically stable government and would prioritise social justice and security.
Merkel, who now seems more likely to secure a fourth term as chancellor, said she fully expected changes to be made on key issues in a 28-page coalition blueprint, calling the document a “framework” that would be “of course intensively negotiated”.
Merkel’s conservatives have said they will work towards forming a new government by Easter. Martin Schulz, the SPD leader, said on Monday he was looking to renegotiate parts of the blueprint, despite strong opposition to concessions within the conservative ranks of Merkel’s Christian Democrats and the allied Christian Social Union (CSU).
Both party leaders recognise that with large numbers of the SPD’s rank and file unhappy with the decision to talk, there is a considerable degree of uncertainty as to whether party members will give the final deal their blessing.
Just over 56% of party delegates at a conference in Bonn voted in favour of a grand coalition, or GroKo, but the decision was met with a lukewarm response both within the conference hall and beyond. Schulz said afterwards he had a “duty to fight for all those who had voted against”.
The Jusos, or young Social Democrats, led the opposition to holding talks, warning party members that a third grand coalition in 12 years could prove so unpopular that it could spell the demise of Germany’s oldest political force. They argued that the party, whose popularity ratings have sunk to around 18% in the last few days, would be better able to renew its fortunes in opposition.
A poll commissioned by Der Spiegel magazine indicated that a majority of the German public was against a new GroKo, with more than half of 5,000 respondents rating the decision negatively and 40% viewing it positively.
The biggest opposition was among the 18-29 age group, making up 65.6% of those who viewed it negatively, whilst those in the 65-plus group made up 53.5% of those who viewed it positively.
Merkel held a preliminary meeting with Schulz and Horst Seehofer, the CSU leader, on Monday ahead of formal talks that are expected to begin early this week.
Key sticking points include changes to the family reunion rules for refugees, a move towards a “citizen’s insurance” to replace private and public healthcare and a tightening of rules for short-term employment contracts.
Among the critics of the SPD’s decision were the far-left Die Linke, one of whose leaders compared it to “committing hara-kiri”, a reference to the Japanese practice of ritual suicide.
Jörg Meuthen, a leader of the far-right populist Alternative für Deutschland, which is poised to become the strongest opposition in the Bundestag in the event of the GroKo going ahead, said the SPD was “on a trundling blind flight”.
Much of the commentary on Monday focused on Schulz, a former European parliament president whose career would have been in tatters had the SPD not voted for a GroKo.
Stating that he was not yet out of hot water, the liberal Süddeutsche Zeitung said it would be little surprise if the SPD decided against a grand coalition after all the months during which Schulz had campaigned “as if a government with the CDU and Angela Merkel was as contaminating as atomic waste”.
If the deal worked out, the SPD would have no choice but to get behind it, the paper continued. “If the party enters a coalition with the reluctance of a passenger with a fear of flying entering a Boeing 747, they will only continue in a downward spiral.”"

Germany has inched a step closer to forming a new government after the centre-left Social Democratic party (SPD) gave its lukewarm endorsement for a renewed Angela Merkel-led “grand coalition”.
At a special SPD congress in Bonn that welcomed a speech by the party’s leader, Martin Schulz, with sarcastic applause and saw standing ovations for his fiercest critics, 56% of the party’s delegates voted in favour of moving on to the second and final stage of coalition talks with Merkel’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
The cautious green light provides major relief not just for the beleaguered leaders of Germany’s two largest parties but also European heads of government, who have been holding off on major strategic decisions since federal elections in September.
After attempts to form an unorthodox “Jamaica” coalition between the CDU, the pro-business Free Democrats and the Green party collapsed in November, a no vote from SPD delegates would not only have put Schulz’s job on the line but would have raised new questions over Merkel’s future.
The leadership of Merkel's Christian Democrats will gather in Berlin tonight to discuss the outcome of the SPD party conference, and will almost certainly give green light to move on to the next stage of the coalition talks, which will likely start on Tuesday.Merkel and Schulz's parties will then spend the next two to three weeks thrashing out a coalition agreement, with the start of the carnival season, 12 February, mooted as a deadline for the second round of talks.Once the coalition treaty has been finalised, there is one final hurdle: a vote for all of the SPD's 443,000 members. The voting process could take as long as three weeks and could potentially unravel weeks of negotiations and throw both the political futures of Martin Schulz and Angela Merkel into doubt.
“The SPD must and will be visible, audible and recognisable,” Schulz had vowed at the end of a week spent rallying support at party offices across the country.
The former president of the European parliament defended the results of the initial phase of exploratory talks with Merkel’s centre-right party, insisting that the resulting coalition paper represented “a revolution” in German education policy as well as “a manifesto for a European Germany”.
“If we want to shape things in and for Europe, then we cannot wait a few more years,” he told the party congress. “Important decisions have to be made now – not in three, four, five years.”
Social Democrat leadership on EU issues, he said, would amount to “the end of a European policy in which Germany has only a ‘no’ to offer” and “an end to the spirit of neoliberalism”.
But the reaction of the 600 delegates to the 62-year-old’s promises remained reserved throughout. When Schulz said he had taken a call from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, on Saturday, there were audibly sarcastic groans from some parts of the hall. Many members would prefer their party to emulate the more overtly left-leaning policies of the British Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, rather than those of the self-declared centrist French president.
Schulz’s critics complain that the first round of coalition talks failed to deliver a single “lighthouse policy” that voters would recognise and remember above the din of daily politics.
During last year’s election campaign, the SPD had made much of a plan to abolish Germany’s dual public-private health insurance system in favour of a single “citizen’s insurance” – a policy now absent from the coalition papers.
Following the September elections at which the SPD was punished with the worst national election result since Germany became a federal republic in 1949, many supporters believe the party needs to reinvent itself in opposition.
With so many casting their vote against their leader’s recommendation, a mere show of hands did not yield a visible majority. After a nervous delay, an official count showed that 362 delegates out of 642 had endorsed the party’s official line.
The lukewarm reaction to Schulz’s speech had contrasted with enthusiastic applause for the 28-year-old leader of the Young Socialists, the SPD’s youth branch.
Kevin Kühnert, who has become the most prominent face of the internal campaign against a renewal of the alliance that has governed Germany for the past four years, said he felt his party was trapped in an “endless loop” of coalition-forming under Merkel: “We don’t want to, but we have to.”
Around Bonn’s World Conference Centre, many SPD supporters sported red gnomes’ hats – a reference to conservative politicians who have dismissed the campaign of Kühnert’s coalition sceptics as “the uprising of the dwarves”.
“Let’s be dwarves today,” the Young Socialist leader said in his speech, “so that one day we can again be giants.”
Social Democrats from the party’s influential branches in Hesse and North-Rhine Westphalia insisted over the weekend that Schulz and his team should focus on gaining additional assurances from Merkel in the next round of talks – an ambitious goal in light of Sunday’s result.
Supporters of the world’s oldest social democratic party also fear that the same grand coalition constellation that could bring much-needed stability to decision-making processes in Europe could prove harmful to the health of Germany’s national political system in the long run.
Under a renewed grand coalition, the rightwing populist party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) would form the largest opposition force in the Bundestag. Commentators point at Austria’s recent rightward lurch after a decade of grand coalitions as proof of the view that lengthy spells of centrist rule can fan support for extremist political parties.
Schulz actively tried to fend off such criticism in his speech: “I know some say that another grand coalition would further strengthen the rightwing fringe. But who says that fresh elections wouldn’t also strengthen the right?”
Some polls after the first round of exploratory coalition talks have seen the SPD drop to record lows of 18.5% while the AfD has consolidated September’s 12.6% of the vote.
With the next phase of coalition talks likely to take two to three weeks, and the SPD insisting on putting the coalition treaty that will emerge from it to a vote among its members, the waiting for a new German government capable of making decisions is likely to continue until the end of February."

Germany’s young social democrats are demanding a clean break with Angela Merkel’s conservatives before a crucial vote on Sunday that will decide the country’s political future.
The SPD leadership, which unanimously backs entering a “grand coalition” with centre-right parties (the so-called GroKo), and the youth wing of the party (the Jusos) were making last-ditch scrambles for support on Saturday among the 600 delegates eligible to vote at a special party conference in Bonn. The deal they are voting on has the potential to topple both Merkel and SPD leader Martin Schulz.
The warring factions within Germany’s oldest political party know that the decision could make or break the SPD. The party has, for years, seen its popularity slide, most dramatically in September’s general election – by which time it had served in a coalition for eight of the 12 years of Merkel’s rule – when it scored its worst result for almost 80 years.
Schulz, who was initially vehemently opposed to a coalition, has appealed to members to recognise their sense of historic responsibility, recalling how the SPD was the only party to vote against the law that enabled the Hitler dictatorship in 1933. Now, he said, the party has the responsibility to revive social democracy by offering a fresh vision for Germany and Europe from within government.
But opponents to a deal, led by the Jusos (Jungsozialisten), argue that the responsibility lies in ensuring the party’s survival, which they say is possible only if it has the chance to renew itself in opposition. They also want to prevent the far-right AfD from becoming the main opposition in the Bundestag, a position it would hold in the case of a grand coalition.
On Thursday, at its last meeting before Sunday’s crucial vote, the Berlin wing of Jusos was marvelling at the success of their campaign and discussing tactics over soft drinks.
“We are very clear about our position,” the deputy leader, Benedikt Rüdesheim, 29, an employment lawyer, said. “Some people say we are egotistical and the SPD has a duty to go into government. We say that in the long term it’s better to ensure the SPD has a future, and we can only do that if we stay out of government for the next four years.” Anna Müller, 29, another deputy, who is also a human rights campaigner, added: “We are the ones who have really had the courage of our convictions to say this. Many others in the party, who are also of this opinion but were afraid to voice it, have been given a strong voice to speak out on Sunday.”
But Volker Heckler, a retired senior budgetary administrator from Berlin, who joined the party 57 years ago, said that while the grand coalition was not an ideal option, for the sake of European stability it was the only choice. “We cannot afford to stand by and allow the alternatives – a minority government or new elections. We would be punished even more at the ballot box next time round.”
If the Jusos position wins the vote on Sunday, the SPD will have to abandon talks, setting Germany on a further, much longer, period of deadlock. It is likely that Schulz would be ousted, and Merkel’s future would also be in extreme doubt. If the leadership wins, official coalition talks between the SPD and the conservative alliance of Christian Democrats and the Christian Social Union will be able to proceed.
But even then the drama will not be over. Once a deal is reached, the party’s 450,000 members will still have the chance to revoke it in a postal vote, which Schulz has insisted on, meaning that the final outcome of this gripping political drama will only be revealed, at the earliest, in a month’s time."

Leading Social Democrats in Germany are engaged in a fierce battle of wills ahead of a crunch vote on Sunday over whether to endorse in-depth coalition negotiations with Angela Merkel’s conservatives.
The party has become the focal point of a tense political drama almost four months after an inconclusive election left Germany in a state of limbo. If delegates at a special conference on Sunday vote against a grand coalition, Germany will be heading either for new elections or a minority government, neither of which is a popular choice and will leave Merkel’s political future hanging by a thread.
Martin Schulz, the SPD’s embattled leader, has been criss-crossing the country this week in an effort to secure party members’ backing for a deal. He said on Wednesday it was difficult to tell whether he had the support of enough delegates.
Schulz said he was encouraged by signs that members had been “drawn together through our exchanges rather than torn apart” before the conference in Bonn.
But the SPD faithful are riven over the issue, with some arguing that to enter into another grand coalition, or “GroKo”, with Merkel’s conservative alliance could further damage the party’s popularity and possibly even lead to its disintegration.
The rise of the rightwing populist and anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) looms large in the debate. Some in the SPD say that by siding with Merkel, the party would ease the way for the AfD – which entered the Bundestag for the first time in September – to become the largest opposition force in parliament.
Sigmar Gabriel, the party’s former leader and now the foreign minister, said the world was looking to Germany to find a swift solution. “It is no exaggeration: this coming Sunday it’s not only Europe that is looking spellbound at the SPD party conference, but many people far further afield. The world will be watching Bonn for real on Sunday,” he said.
The looming decision has plunged Germany’s oldest political party into nothing less than an existential crisis. Leading the opposition to a coalition is the party’s youth wing, the Jusos (Young Socialists), who have coined the phrase “NoGroKo” to sum up their campaign against what they say would be nothing short of a betrayal of social democratic values.
Schulz has concentrated his campaigning efforts on Germany’s largest state, North Rhine-Westphalia, home to about a quarter of the 600 delegates due in Bonn. The state’s SPD faction – unlike others elsewhere in Germany – has declined to publicly position itself ahead of the vote.
Leaving a meeting of party delegates in a Düsseldorf hotel on Tuesday, Schulz was greeted by Jusos members’ angry cries of “Nie, nie, nie wieder Gro Ko” (Never, never, never again GroKo).
Kevin Kühnert, the head of Jusos, has emerged as a political star and is regarded as the biggest danger to Merkel, having rallied the party base and won considerable support for his cause. The 28-year-old politics student from Berlin has called the mood among the party’s base “devastating”.
Kühnert has said he did not join the SPD “in order to see it repeatedly bang its head against the same brick wall”. Young members of the party, he has argued, “have an interest in seeing that something of this joint remains, damn it.” The party’s restoration as a leading political force in Germany “will either take place outside a grand coalition or it won’t happen at all,” he has said.
The party’s leadership, including Andreas Nahles, the chair of the SPD parliamentary group and a former Jusos head, have been rattled by the passion shown by the Jusos members and by opinion polls showing the party has slipped to 18.5% – one of its lowest ratings – after it agreed last week on a 28-page prototype coalition action plan. Internal critics say the blueprint bears little resemblance to the party’s ideals. Sticking points include health, pensions and education.
Even if SPD delegates vote in favour of a coalition, the drama will be far from over. More serious talks between the SPD and the conservatives could begin immediately and would be expected to last around two weeks. but Schulz would then insist on putting the final agreement to the party’s 450,000 members in a postal vote, which could take a further three weeks."

Crisis? What crisis? With its buoyant economy, increasing industrial output, renewed export boom and its record low unemployment, Germany looks to be getting along fine without the little matter of a government. This week, official data in Berlin showed the workshop of Europe’s economy returning to something like full speed. Output has registered its best monthly rise since 2009, while Germany’s trade surplus has widened the way it did in the days before the eurozone crisis. Now even the nearly four-month post-election absence of a government in Berlin is being dealt with, after Angela Merkel and the social democrats reached agreement on Friday morning on a programme for a new coalition government.
All this renewed stability is good news for Germany, and thus for the European Union, and thus also, in a Brexit context, perhaps for Britain too. After the rise of the rightwing AfD in September’s election, it was essential that Germany’s established parties should find a way to work together to renew their social market model for new times. But it would be prudent not to break open the Sekt too soon. Mrs Merkel’s CDU-CSU conservative bloc has certainly struck a coalition deal with Martin Schulz’s centre-left SPD. But it is far from certain that the deal will hold.
The 28-page agreement is the result of five days of talks culminating in a 24-hour all-nighter, fuelled by currywurst, before the deal was proclaimed on Friday morning. It contains lots of policy detail on every front: pension guarantees, equalisation of employer and employee healthcare contributions, more spending on schools, tax breaks for lower earners, more police jobs, and an annual cap of 180-200,000 refugees allowed into Germany. There is also a pledge to embrace Emmanuel Macron’s eurozone reform ideas, putting Germany back at the heart of the EU after a period in which the French president has had the field largely to himself.
But there are mountains to climb before Mrs Merkel can begin her fourth term in the chancellery. The most immediate problem is that Mr Schulz must get his party to support the deal. This will not be straightforward. Both before and after September’s poor SPD election performance, the party mood was against taking part in another grand coalition with Mrs Merkel. Within the party’s youth wing, that is still the case. Mr Schulz ruled such a deal out after the SPD had lost a fifth of its support in the election. But the failure of Mrs Merkel to form a four-party government with the liberal FDP and the environmental Greens left a renewed grand coalition as the only viable alternative.
Everything now hangs on two tests within the SPD. The first, on January 21, is an extraordinary party conference in Bonn to consider the joint programme. The second, if Mr Schulz wins in Bonn, is a referendum among the SPD’s 450,000 members. Much will depend on whether the document agreed this week is felt by rank-and-file SPD members to contain enough of its own demands to overcome the widespread feeling last year that the party would be better off in opposition than to be the junior party in a Merkel-led coalition for the third time. The absence from the programme of a big signature SPD pledge, at a time when industrial militancy over wages is growing in Germany, will test Mr Schulz’s authority.
If the SPD balks, Mrs Merkel will be left with a choice between minority rule and new elections. Even if it doesn’t, the chancellor is likely to be even more cautious than before about politically difficult change. It would be reckless to write off early 21st-century Europe’s most important politician too soon. But the post-Merkel era is beginning to loom."

Leaders of Angela Merkel’s conservative Christian Democratic Union bloc and the centre-left Social Democrats have cleared a first hurdle towards the formation of the next German government after marathon overnight talks.
Merkel, the German chancellor, and the Social Democrats’ (SPD) leader, Martin Schulz, on Friday morning recommended moving on to formal coalition negotiations after agreeing compromises on issues ranging from European integration via healthcare to migration quotas.
“We have realised that the world isn’t waiting for us,” Merkel said at a press conference on Friday morning. “We are convinced that Europe needs a fresh start and have developed the right ideas to go with it.”
“I believe we have reached outstanding results,” Schulz added.
Their optimism comes at the end of a period of rare political uncertainty, prompted by inconclusive federal election results in September. The collapse of talks to form an unorthodox “Jamaica” coalition between the CDU, the FDP and the Green party even led to speculation that Merkel would resign as she faced the prospect of leading a weakened minority government.
German media reported that the breakthrough was reached after Merkel’s conservatives ceded to SPD demands for an equalisation of health-insurance contributions made by employers and employees.
Under Germany’s multipayer healthcare system, employers and employees previously contributed an equal amount towards each person’s statutory sickness fund, but since the system was changed in 2005, people have increasingly had to shoulder additional payments.
In return, reports indicated the Bavarian sister party of Merkel’s CDU had succeeded in its goal to limit the number of family members who can be reunited with refugees that have been granted asylum in Germany.
A 28-page coalition paper, presented by Merkel as a “give-and-take” compromise, suggests family-reunification arrivals should be capped at 1,000 a month, and overall immigration be capped between 180,000 and 220,000 people.
The CSU leader, Horst Seehofer, who provoked Merkel’s ire last week by inviting Hungarian president Viktor Orban to a party gathering in Bavaria, said on Friday he was “very happy” that his initial optimism about the talks had been rewarded.
Christian Democrat and Social Democrat leaders also agreed to lower the tax surcharge, introduced to fund the reunification of east and west Germany, by €10bn (£9bn) by 2021.
The coalition paper states the next German government will be prepared to make higher contributions to the EU budget, as well as support “funds for economic convergence and social convergence and support of structural reforms that can be a starting point for future investment budget for eurozone”.
In a message which will be warmly received by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, Germany’s two large centrist parties stressed the need for more Franco-German cooperation: “The renewal of the EU will only succeed if Germany and France work towards it with all their strength.”
France gets six mentions in the paper, which will become a blueprint for further talks in the coming weeks, compared with three mentions for Turkey, two mentions for the US, one mention each for Russia and China, and no mention at all for the UK.
The French government spokesman, Benjamin Griveaux, welcomed the agreement, describing it as “important for the stability and future of Franco-German relations”.
While the paper emphasises that “Europe has to take its fate into its own hand more than before”, there are no specific targets for future military spending, nor any mention at all of Nato.
In the early stages of exploratory talks this week, it was reported Germany’s would-be coalition partners had agreed to drop plans to lower carbon dioxide emissions by 40% from 1990 levels by 2020.
Without additional measures, Germany will miss its 2020 emissions target, due to better than expected economic growth. The coalition paper foresees the new government drawing up a timetable for phasing out coal power by the end of this year.
Negotiation talks at the SPD headquarters in Berlin on Thursday night were accompanied by noisy protests from both climate change activists and workers in the country’s coal industry.
SPD delegates will vote on whether to move talks to the next stage at a party conference on 21 January. Even then, SPD leaders will still have to sell the coalition to their membership, and will face resistance from many MPs and supporters who believe another coalition with Merkel could prove an existential challenge to their party’s future.
“If Schulz and Seehofer both find the outcome of the talks ‘outstanding’, then at least one of them is wrong,” tweeted Kevin Kühnert, the chairperson of the SPD’s youth wing.
“A proverbial lick of paint, many promises, a lot of kludge,” said Marco Bülow, a leading MP on the left wing of the SPD. “This is not a fresh start, not even a standstill. The past has shown that the [Christian Democratic] Union will prevent progressive plans.”
If the SPD membership votes down the coalition treaty next month, Merkel’s only remaining options will be to form a minority government or to hold new elections.
The Social Democrats had initially ruled out another coalition with Merkel after poor results in the election on 24 September, but reconsidered after her talks with two other parties failed."

Germany’s beleaguered chancellor returned to the negotiating table on Sunday with politicians from the Social Democratic party (SPD) and representatives of her Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), to stave off the end of “Merkelism” by re-establishing the coalition that governed Germany from 2013 to 2017.
Angela Merkel’s efforts will involve tough bargaining with the centre-left, which eyes control over the country’s well-stocked state coffers as a reward for entering a new coalition – in the knowledge that failure of the talks could spell the end of the Merkel era.
“I think that it can be done. We will work very swiftly and very intensively,” Merkel told journalists as she arrived at the Social Democrats’ headquarters on Sunday.
“I am going into these talks with optimism. At the same time it is clear to me that we will have an enormous piece of work in front of us over the next few days but we are willing to take it on and to bring a good result.”
Following the collapse of talks to form an unorthodox “Jamaica” coalition with the Free Democrats and the Green party in November, a centrist alliance would guarantee the leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) her best chance of a stable government for a fourth term in office.
But historically poor results for both parties at last September’s elections mean that a new “grand coalition” could barely lay claim to such a name, and sliding polls are increasing pressure on the two political tribes to retreat behind orthodox party lines.
The SPD leader, Martin Schulz, who has previously ruled out forming a coalition with Merkel, has to win over a highly sceptical party membership that will get a final vote on whether to enter an alliance with the CDU, and is likely to seek protections for increased social security spending and infrastructure investment.
Key figures in the SPD believe Schulz can only guarantee such promises by laying claim to the previously CDU-run finance ministry. A centre-left finance minister could relax Germany’s balanced budget rules and work to meet French president Emmanuel Macron’s goals for reforming the eurozone.
The previous SPD leader Sigmar Gabriel’s decision to pick the economic and foreign ministries as trophy posts in 2013 is now widely seen within the party as a strategic mistake. But Schulz’s proposals will meet fierce resistance from the conservatives on the other side of the table, many of whom look towards the rightward-lurching government of the new Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, as a model to emulate.
Former transport minister Alexander Dobrindt called for a 'conservative revolution' against a left-liberal mainstream
Facing state elections in Bavaria in the autumn this year, Merkel’s allies in the CSU in particular have ratcheted up their rhetoric. Politicians from the party have over the past week called for cuts in benefits to refugees, mandatory age tests for asylum seekers, and extending the suspension of Germany’s policy to reunite refugees with their families.
In an comment article for the newspaper Die Welt, former transport minister Alexander Dobrindt called for a “conservative revolution” against a left-liberal mainstream he saw as typified by the culture of Berlin’s Prenzlauer Berg district – a hotbed of dissident culture in 1980s East Germany, now itself a byword for gentrification.
At Friday’s party conference in Seeon-Seebruck in southern Bavaria, the CSU leader, Horst Seehofer, risked antagonising Merkel by inviting the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, the European Union’s most vocal critic of the German chancellor’s open-borders stance during the 2015 refugee crisis. The populist leader said on Friday he believed 2018 would be “the year of restoring the will of the people in Europe”.
Merkel, meanwhile, goes into negotiations from one of the weakest positions of her leadership. A survey by the public broadcaster ARD has shown that more Germans prefer fresh elections to a renewal of last term’s grand coalition. A majority (69%) of those polled said Merkel’s party had failed to address concerns caused by the refugee crisis, and her personal approval ratings have dropped since the September elections. However, 53% still say that they would approve of Merkel being the next chancellor, and as many as 93% said she remained a good chancellor.
The 63-year-old has rejected a so-called “KoKo” or “cooperation coalition” option floated by the Social Democrats, which could involve the SPD and the CDU/CSU forming an alliance and agreeing on some issues while leaving trickier points to parliamentary debates.
Shortly before Christmas, the tabloid Bild quoted the senior CDU politician Norbert Lammert as saying that Merkel would step down if talks with the Social Democrats collapsed and there were fresh elections – comments which the former leader of the Bundestag later denied having made.
German media have tipped the Saarland state premier, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, as one of the few successor candidates who would fit Merkel’s mould of pragmatic centrist conservatism. But the CDU politician is relatively unknown even in her own country, and would need a spell in a ministerial post to build up her profile.
One leading German public intellectual has predicted that the next government is unlikely to last a full four-year term, even if Merkel and Schulz manage to come to an agreement in the coming weeks. “We are in a transition phase,” said the political scientist Herfried Münkler in an interview with Die Welt. “Since we are not used to transitional phases – unlike the Italians, for example – the end of Merkelism is a special situation for us, and an exciting one.”
Münkler, who is also a bestselling author of books on global history, said that any political era required a phase of renewal and revitalisation after around 25 years. “We are without doubt in the middle of such a phase,” he declared, “where the decline of a politically leading figure goes hand in hand with significant changes in the surrounding conditions.”
Exploratory talks are expected to last for about a week. On 21 January, SPD delegates will decide at a special party conference whether to start proper talks, which could last until mid-February. The Social Democrats will then allow their membership a vote on whether to enter a coalition with the CDU.
Wrangling over fallout from the European refugee crisis dominated last year’s failed coalition talks with the liberal Free Democratic party and Greens, and is likely to top this year’s negotiations agenda. While the two parties will easily agree to speed up deportations of rejected asylum seekers, Martin Schulz, leader of the centre-left Social Democratic party, rejected conservative proposals to extend the current ban on reuniting refugees with their families, which runs out on 16 March.
The SPD wants wholesale reform of health insurance, equalising the contributions made by employers and employees and unifying the two-tier system of private and public health insurances. Politicians from Merkel’s CDU say the plans would put private health insurers out of business.
Germany’s two big centre parties may find it easier to find common ground on investing in the country’s healthy fiscal surplus in a marquee infrastructure project, such as a state-funded house-building programme to take steam out of the overheating rental market in cities."

European leaders have been at pains over the past 12 months to emphasise that Brexit is not the only or even the biggest issue confronting the EU. They do so, in part, to keep the British in their place. But they also speak the truth. Whether it is eurozone reform, the rise of xenophobic extremism or growing pressure exerted by Russia, Europe has an awful lot on its plate without worrying overmuch about what Boris Johnson wants.
Yet the EU’s biggest challenge in 2018 may be none of the above. It comes from within. It has been slowly emerging along the bloc’s central and eastern flanks since the so-called Visegrád Group of Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic acceded in 2004. And it has sharpened into all-out confrontation following Brussels’ decision last month to punish the rightwing governments in Warsaw and Budapest for their rejection of migrant quotas and alleged disregard for EU values.
The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791. It is published by Guardian News & Media and is editorially independent.
Front and centre in this fight is Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s prime minister, who wears his contempt for the liberal, integrationist European agenda advocated by Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the commission president, like a badge of pride. Orbán has called for the defence of Europe’s “Christian culture” against “Muslim invasion”. And he accuses Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, of “moral imperialism” in supposedly forcing Syrian refugees on Europe in 2015.
Orbán’s crude antics have resulted in elevated poll ratings at home, his expected re-election this spring, and a raised profile as the voice of heightened central and eastern European resistance to Franco-German domination of the EU. The prospect of Britain no longer being around to offset the influence of Berlin and Paris has fuelled this reactionary, Eurosceptic dynamic among smaller EU states whose membership London formerly championed – yet another unwelcome Brexit outcome.
Orbán took the fight to Merkel last week, promoting his destructive nationalist-populist, anti-migrant agenda at a conference of the German leader’s CSU coalition partner in Bavaria. By encouraging opposition to Merkel’s approach among her conservative supporters, Orbán could help scupper her last chance of forming a government following 2017’s election reverses. If Merkel falls, a political colossus will have been brought low by relative nonentities, to the lasting disadvantage of a Europe where moderate, commonsense centre-ground politics is eroding.
Orbán now claims a new friend in the almost but not quite neo-fascist coalition that won power in Austria at the close of 2017. But it is Poland, under the ugly tutelage of the authoritarian Law and Justice party, that has emerged as his closest ally. Its government, too, is at legal odds with Brussels. And Poland’s leaders, too, sense a chance to influence the EU’s overall direction of travel. It was Poland’s duty, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the country’s de facto leader, said last year, to “show the sick Europe of today the path back to health, fundamental values, true freedom and a stronger civilisation based on Christianity”.
Speaking alongside Orbán in Budapest last week, Mateusz Morawiecki, Poland’s prime minister, predicted a “year of great battles” against western Europe’s multicultural and integrationist values. It was time to scrap the EU’s migration policy, which was a “spectacular failure”. But bigger, glittering prizes were in sight. “I believe like-minded nations like ourselves together can influence Europe’s future in a very positive way … We don’t want to live in an empire but rather in an alliance of free nations,” he said. Nigel Farage would be proud.
The biggest punch-up in 2018 is likely to be over the EU’s next seven-year budget, which kicks in from 2021. Poland and Hungary are net beneficiaries. France and Germany are the biggest net contributors, their burden rendered more onerous by Britain’s retreat. Any cutbacks would hurt Warsaw and Budapest more than most, which may be why they are getting their retaliation in first. Nor can the eastern refuseniks count on unquestioning solidarity within Visegrád. Slovakia, a eurozone member, says its EU loyalties outweigh regional alliances.
Germany and the wealthier west European countries are now linking the future allocation of billions of euros in structural funds to improved cooperation from Poland and Hungary. Given the nationalistic, anti-Brussels mood in many smaller member states, such tactics could backfire. The obvious risk is that a big-boys’ crackdown on dissenters, coinciding with a difficult Brexit denouement, could leave the EU struggling for cohesion on both eastern and western fronts. Once again, the dream of a strong, united Europe may be slipping away."

Angela Merkel’s New Year address on German television has acquired all the familiarity of the Queen’s Christmas speech. So much so that one newspaper ran a front page showing the chancellor’s 12 years in shiny-jacket attire under the headline, “Can the Social Democrats put up with another one of these?”
The needling of the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), for preparing to support Merkel’s fourth term in office, highlights a more irreverent tone towards “Mutti”, as she restarts stalled talks to hammer out a new coalition.
The chancellor has been attacked by some of her own former supporters for her unwillingness to be more open about the practical implications of absorbing the 2015 wave of refugees, and for allegedly failing to identify warmly enough with the victims of the Christmas terror attack in Berlin in 2016. In other words, she is being treated like any other long-stay politician showing signs of fatigue. On a road trip through Germany I heard grumbles and frustration about a chancellor who only a year ago was hailed as virtually superhuman.
It is no longer absurd to suggest Theresa May could outlast the German leader in office
It is now just over three months since an election which saw Merkel and her SPD rivals punished at the polls, a sharp rise in support for the far right, and votes scattered liberally across smaller protest parties, from the free-market liberals in the FDP to the Greens and leftwingers Die Linke. The public is wearying of coalition talks that have failed to yield either a “Jamaica” coalition of the Christian Democrats, the FDP and the Greens, or (so far) a grand coalition of the Christian Democrats and SPD.
Merkel’s ability to choose a coalition deal that suits her is less powerful than it was. For the first time, her message to the SPD – “the world won’t wait for us” – was part chiding, part imploring. The party, in turn, is hamstrung by leader Martin Schulz, who took them down to a mere fifth of the vote, and foolishly promised after the election not to re-enter a Merkel-led coalition.
Together with Tilo Jung, a video blogger, I hit the autobahns from Berlin into Mecklenburg in the old East – close to the wastelands where Merkel grew up. As a journalist, I covered Germany’s reunification and believe Merkel helped define the positive tone and stability of Germany after 1990. Tilo, by contrast, is impatient with her technocratic language and fudging of awkward choices. Conversely, he is keenest on Merkel because of her response to refugees. I admire the values that led her to act as she did, but fret that, like many liberals now, she is less good at addressing the difficult questions that arise from immigration (whether through open borders or single-handed refugee largesse).
Many insights that struck me came from encounters with Germans beyond the country’s serene self presentation in Berlin – like the Mecklenburg workers we met who worried about low wage levels, and a young couple commuting huge distances to find higher salaries in the old West. We encountered a successful middle-aged voter for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland who had previously been a Merkel loyalist. How she intends to win back such voters (the AfD has high levels of popularity among the under-44s), while remaining true to the spirit of her commitment to open borders in 2015, is a mystery.
The popularity of the small and insurgent parties is causing headaches on the centre-left, as well as the centre-right. Manuela Schwesig, a Mecklenburg SPD politician, talks in forthright language about the failings of coalition politics. One nascent organisation, SPD Plus Plus, is calling for a fresh start and a bigger voice for the grassroots.
For all the barnacles that now attach to her leadership, Merkel will not shrivel as a political force in 2018. Only she has the votes and personal heft to bring together a government. But the strains of the coalition will be intense, and her leadership will be more fraught than ever. It will rely on her rightwing Bavarian sister party, which will demand a larger say in economic matters, with the SPD less inclined to sign up to another round of Merkelism just for a seat at the cabinet table. Her toughening of tone on migrant checks and removal of failed asylum seekers risks appearing erratic.
It is no longer absurd to suggest Theresa May could outlast Merkel in office. So the task for Germany’s durable leader will be to decide more precisely what her chancellorship should represent at home, as well as on the European stage.
Germany’s politics is no longer the stuff of soporific speeches and a supine parliament – the shift reflects a more fragmented society and a more assertive electorate. Merkel will need to either use her wiles to rise to a new German reality, or begin to make way for the post-Mutti era.

Of all the calamities that have marked Donald Trump’s presidency, one of the most omnipresent has been his approach to diplomatic relations.
The president has lashed out at a swath of countries during his 13 months in office, sometimes on issues relating to national security, but more often for seemingly no reason at all.
Trump is, at least, consistent in his treatment of foreign powers – criticizing both enemies and supposed allies alike. Here are some of the countries that have upset the president.
Trump, in what would become a theme, used terrorist attacks to criticize France in February. Apparently referencing the Paris attacks that killed 130 people in November 2015 and the truck attack in Nice in July 2016, Trump lamented that a friend of his who used to like visiting Paris would no longer visit the city.
“I have a friend, he’s a very, very substantial guy. He loves the City of Lights, he loves Paris. For years, every year during the summer, he would go to Paris, was automatic with his wife and his family.
“Hadn’t seen him in a while. And I said, ‘Jim, let me ask you a question: how’s Paris doing?’
“[Jim said]: ‘Paris? I don’t go there any more. Paris is no longer Paris.’”
In March the New Yorker launched an investigation into whether Jim actually exists. It seems unlikely that he does.
“You look at what’s happening,” Trump told a crowd in Florida on 18 February.
“You look at what’s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this?”
The comment came during a section of his speech when Trump was warning of the threat of terrorism, and seemed to imply that there had been an attack or incident in Sweden the night before.
The fact that there had been no incident in Sweden the night before made it particularly difficult to believe. Trump never fully explained what had happened last night in Sweden.
In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump was asked about a potential trade agreement with Britain – given the UK’s imminent departure from the European Union.
Trump’s answer was not very in depth.
“You don’t hear the word Britain any more. It’s very interesting. It’s like, nope,” the president said. Then he started talking about the British Open golf tournament.
Trump did not insult the country per se – just its prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull.
In his first official phone call with Australia’s leader – a sort of get-to-know-you for world leaders – Trump told Turnbull he was dissatisfied with their conversation.
“I have had it. I have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day,” Trump said, according to the transcript of the call.
The US president ended the call abruptly.
“Canada, what they’ve done to our dairy farm workers, it’s a disgrace,” Trump said in April. “Farmers in Wisconsin and New York state are being put out of business.”
The Canadian government has import tariffs in place to protect its dairy farmers, CNN explained, and had been accused of undercutting American farmers. Canada did not immediately respond.
“One of the highest-crime nations in the world,” Trump thundered back in August.
He also accused Mexico – and Canada – of being “very difficult” during the the Nafta renegotiation process.
Of course, Trump has also talked regularly about the need for a wall, and repeatedly said Mexico will pay for it.
“Our country will not pay, under any circumstances, for a wall or physical barrier built on US territory along the Mexican border,” Mexico’s ministry of foreign affairs has said.
“Germany owes vast sums of money to Nato and the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to Germany,” Trump said in March. Numerous media outlets reported that this was untrue. Nato members do not pay money to the organization.
He also didn’t shake Angela Merkel’s hand when they met at the Oval Office.
The next day, he dismissed reports that the meeting had been awkward and then tweeted that Germany owes “vast sums of money to NATO & the United States”, which is false.
Where to start.
Trump has taken to calling Kim Jong-un “Rocket Man” – surely one of the president’s least effective nicknames – and has also referred to the North Korean leader as “a mad man”. Trump also believes North Korea is “a country ruled by a cult”.
North Korea, through state media, has called Trump “an old lunatic”, a “mean trickster”, a “mentally deranged dotard”, a “human reject” and a “hideous criminal”. So perhaps they’re about even.
The US has various anti-missile options, some designed to take down missiles at short-range and others for medium-to-long-range. The US relies heavily on the US Patriot missile and the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defence (THAAD). The US deployed THAAD to South Korea this year to defend against medium-range missiles. There is a three-phased defence system: ground-based missiles on the Korean peninsula; US naval ships stationed in the Pacific; and two bases in Alaska and California that can launch an estimated 36 interceptors.
No air defence system offers anything like a complete guarantee of success. The Pentagon offer repeated assurances that air defence systems would be more than a match for any North Korean attack. But when missile defence systems have been put to the test over the last few decades, the performance has been far from reassuring.

The US provided anti-missile defence systems to Israel and Saudi Arabia during the First Gulf War as protection against Iraq's Scud missiles. It was initially claimed that they had shot down 41 of 42 missiles fired by Iraq. But eventually it was acknowledged that only a few missiles had been hit.

Recent tests of interceptors have provided little comfort – with success rates of around 50% on average. The Pentagon celebrated in May when it destroyed a mock warhead over the Pacific but overall the performance has been spotty. Since the newest intercept system was introduced in 2004 only four of nine intercept attempts have been successful. Of the five tests since 2010, only two have been successful."

Germany’s leaders have admitted that the government failed to provide adequate support to relatives of the victims of last year’s terrorist attack on a Berlin Christmas market, and acknowledged security gaps in the run-up to the atrocity.
A year after Anis Amri, a Tunisian whose asylum application had been turned down months before, rammed a truck into the crowded market at the Breitscheidplatz, killing 12 people and wounding 70, the authorities have been criticised for security failings and their clumsy handling of the aftermath of the assault.
After being accused of failing to personally contact families of victims, the chancellor, Angela Merkel, met them for the first time on Monday.
“The talks were very open and, from the part of those affected, no holds barred, and pointed to the weakness of our country in this situation,” Merkel said as Germany held a day of solemn commemoration for the victims on Tuesday.
“Today is a day of sadness, but also a day of our will to make better things that did not work well,” she said, adding that she had offered to meet the bereaved again in a few months.
President Frank-Walter Steinmeier also told the bereaved and emergency workers at a private church memorial that “it is true that some support came late and remained unsatisfactory”.
“Many family members and injured – many of you – felt abandoned by the state,” he added, recalling the words of a woman whose daughter was killed in the attack.
“I can’t get those words out of my head,” he said, insisting the relatives’ appeal to be heard had “triggered something and set it in motion”.
In the hours after the assault, which was claimed by Islamic State, politicians had put on a brave front and repeated the mantra that Germany would not be cowed by terror. But Steinmeier said such rhetoric had done little for the victims.
“So soon after the attack … these words don’t sound simply defiant and self-confident, but also strangely cold and detached,” he said.
To mark the anniversary, the popular Christmas market was shut all day as the tributes to victims took place.
At midday, Merkel joined relatives in inaugurating a memorial – a 14-metre (46-ft) golden crack in the ground engraved with the victims’ names.
During the evening, there will be a public ecumenical prayer at 8.02pm (1902 GMT) – the exact time when Amri drove his truck into the crowded square – when people can light candles and the church’s bells will chime for 12 minutes.
However, the run-up to the commemoration has been marred by criticism of the authorities by families of the victims.
An open letter by some of the bereaved accused Merkel of failing to personally offer condolences.
In an editorial in the Tagesspiegel newspaper, the justice minister, Heiko Maas, apologised.
“We were not sufficiently prepared to deal with the consequences of such a terror attack,” he wrote. “For that, we can only apologise to the victims and their surviving relatives.”
Kurt Beck, who was commissioned by the government to examine the handling of the aftermath, last week outlined a litany of official failings, including taking up to three days to inform anxious relatives that their loved ones had died, and sending the bereaved late-payment warnings for autopsy bills.
Police also faced criticism after it emerged that Amri, who arrived in Germany in 2015 and registered under numerous identities, should have been deported.
On Sunday, the Welt am Sonntag newspaper said the Tunisian had been under closer surveillance by Germany’s secret service than previously thought, suggesting the authorities might have left him free in order to detect his instigators.
Amri was shot and killed four days after the attack by police in Italy, where he had previously lived."

Angela Merkel is to meet bereaved relatives and survivors of last year’s Berlin Christmas market attack for the first time, two weeks after they sent her an angry letter accusing her of political inaction and failing to acknowledge their suffering.
The German chancellor will meet the group in her office in Berlin on Monday, a day before the anniversary of the attack.
Her spokesman Steffen Seibert said Merkel had felt “the greatest respect” on reading their letter, in which she was accused of a dereliction of duty. He said the victims’ outpouring of their grievances showed “how useful and urgent this meeting is”.
Twelve people died in the attack on 19 December, in which Anis Amri, a Tunisian whose asylum application had been turned down months before, drove a lorry at speed into the Christmas market on Breitscheidplatz. Almost 100 people were injured, many of them in life-changing ways. It was Germany’s first major Islamist-inspired terrorist attack.
The victims included the lorry’s Polish driver, whom Amri shot before he took over the controls. Amri was shot dead by Italian police in a suburb of Milan four days after the attack.
In the letter to Merkel, the victims set out a range of grievances over their treatment, including “the lack of counter-terrorism in Germany, as well as the way we as victims and bereaved have been dealt with”.
In the year since the attack, they wrote, “we note that you have not shared your condolences with us either in person or in writing. In our opinion this means that you have failed to live up to your office.”
They accuse Merkel’s government of failing to address systemic shortcomings that had allowed Amri, who arrived in Germany during the refugee wave in 2015, to apply for asylum numerous times and to remain at large despite the fact he had been classified by security forces as a high-level threat and had a criminal record for drug dealing.
“At a time when the threat posed by dangerous Islamists has greatly increased, you have failed to push ahead with expanding resources and reforming the confused official structures for fighting these dangers,” they wrote.
In what was widely interpreted as her acknowledgement of the grievances, Merkel visited the site of the attack last Monday, speaking to stallholders at the market and thanking those who had risked their lives to come to the aid of those hit by the truck and by falling debris.
“Frau Merkel has behaved shabbily towards us,” said Sigrid Rheinsberg, who lost her daughter, Dorit Krebs, 53, in the attack.
Her husband, Hans-Georg, said: “Frau Merkel embraced the refugees but has put us at arm’s length. We’ve been completely ignored.”
The couple told Der Spiegel they felt strongly that the German state was complicit in Amri’s murderous act. “The state should bear part of the blame,” Sigrid Rheinsberg said, referring to multiple errors made by the authorities. “It wasn’t the perpetrator, but it is complicitous.”
Rami Elyakim, an Israeli who lost his wife of 40 years, Dalia, and who was badly injured himself, said he had been appalled to learn of the catalogue of errors made leading up to the attack.
“An Islamist with 14 different names allowed to move about freely?” he said in an interview, referring to the authorities’ repeated failures to apprehend Amri. “They could have put him in prison or at least been on his trail.”
Elyakim said his medical treatment had been excellent but that he had received pitifully little financial support from the German state. He had had to depend on help from the Israeli state, which had acknowledged him as a victim of terror, he said. “Germany has done nothing,” he told the newspaper Bild.
Many of the victims say that on top of having to wade through a bureaucratic minefield, they have struggled financially and have received paltry compensation payments. Some have taken out bank loans to cover the rents and mortgages of those who died or on behalf of those so badly injured they can no longer work.
Almost all the bereaved complained that they had no letter of condolence from the German state and that the first official recognition they had received that their loved ones were dead was a bill from the institute of forensic medicine demanding a fee of €51, payable within 30 days, for certifying the cause of death.
“I didn’t want to believe it myself,” said Kurt Beck, an MP for the Social Democrats. “But I saw one of these letters with my own eyes.”
Beck, who was appointed as official representative of the victims and bereaved in February, acknowledged the catalogue of errors made by state organisations before and after the attack in a report published last week. He has recommended a long list of improvements, including better communication with victims and much higher compensation payments.
Most victims have so far received little more than €10,000, and only then after going through a highly bureaucratic application process. Beck said a department should be set up within the justice ministry to act as a coordination centre to deal with any future attacks.
“The government cannot leave the injured and bereaved to deal with the situation themselves,” Beck said. “What’s most important is to help them out in their hour of need, to not have them running from pillar to post trying to establish the facts and what they’re entitled to.”
On Tuesday, the anniversary of the attack, officials and survivors will gather to unveil a memorial to those killed. Relatives will be invited to fill with liquid gold a 14-metre-long gash indicating the path the lorry took, and symbolic of the scar that remains, according to officials.
The steps leading up to the Memorial Church, which was bombed during the second world war and remains in large part a ruin as a deliberate reminder of the horrors of war, will be engraved with the names of the victims and their countries of origin."

In a speech at the SPD’s party conference in Berlin that called for the creation of a “United States of Europe” by 2025, as well as a more robust social security net and a phasing out of coal power, Martin Schulz made the case for entering open-ended talks with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
“We don’t want to govern at any price,” Schulz said. “But we also shouldn’t refuse to govern at any price.”
SPD delegates later voted overwhelmingly to allow their party’s leadership to enter talks with the CDU. The vote means leaders can discuss options including a renewed “grand coalition”, an informal cooperation or a formal agreement to tolerate a conservative minority government by not voting down certain parliamentary motions.
Attempts to build Germany’s next government have been at a standstill since last month’s collapse of coalition talks between the CDU, the Free Democrats and the Greens.
Other European states have expressed their growing impatience with Germany’s political paralysis. Leaders including the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, have called on Schulz to break the deadlock.
The SPD leader acknowledged those appeals on Thursday when he warned that “the continent cannot afford four more years of German European policy a la Schäuble”, referring to the austerity measures of the country’s conservative former finance minister.
Schulz told delegates that he wanted EU member states to sign off on a “constitutional treaty” that committed the bloc to take steps towards a federal Europe – a proposal likely to be met with some resistance from Merkel and other EU leaders.
“Such a constitutional treaty has to be written by a convention that includes civil society and the people. This constitutional treaty will then have to be put to the member states and those that don’t approve it will automatically have to leave the EU,” Schulz said.
The SPD leader called for stronger social security for workers in the digital services economy, increased investment in academic and vocational education, and binding green energy targets. Phasing out coal energy was inevitable, Schulz said, and the next government should focus on creating new opportunities for those currently employed in the sector.
“Let’s first see which policies we can push through and then decide about the precise form in which we do it,” he said.
Despite the vote by SPD delegates to allow talks with the CDU to start, Thursday’s party conference also laid bare the centre left’s deep-seated reservations about teaming up with Merkel as a junior coalition partner for a third time in 12 years.
Schulz apologised for presiding over his party’s worst result since the second world war; the SPD was well beaten by the CDU in September’s elections.
Some delegates used their speeches to vent their annoyance with the party leadership opening the door to talks with Merkel, expressing fears that a new “grand coalition” could deal their party an existential blow. Surveys show that a majority of SPD members would prefer their party to prop up a Merkel-led minority government rather than rejoin a coalition."

Martin Schulz will seek to end weeks of political paralysis in Germany by attempting to persuade his Social Democrats (SPD) to form a grand coalition with Angela Merkel’s conservatives, weeks after he warned that such a scenario would be a disaster for the party.
The SPD’s three-day party conference, which starts on Thursday in Berlin, also marks a crucial moment in the political career of the former European parliament president, as he faces being ousted as party leader for his U-turn.
The 61-year-old has been in the spotlight since talks to form a coalition between the chancellor’s conservative alliance, the pro-business Free Democrats and the Greens collapsed last month, plunging Germany into political uncertainty.
Schulz, who delivered his party’s poorest result since the second world war in September elections, has become a potential kingmaker, but only after having rowed back from initially excluding a repeat of the conservative-SPD coalition that ruled Germany for the previous four years.
After the election Schulz and other senior SPD officials were vehement that going into opposition was the only way to reconstruct his battered party.
His U-turn – which he was pushed into by his own MPs – has earned Schulz much ridicule both nationally and within the SPD and led to charges that he is unfit to continue to lead Germany’s oldest political party.
Over the next few days he will attempt to embolden members with a four-page manifesto of demands the SPD would take with it into any coalition talks. They include abolishing private health insurance, stricter climate protection goals, the end to a ban on some asylum seekers bringing family members to Germany, improved tax arrangements for families and pension reform.
SPD members will also be asked to examine the possibilities of tolerating a minority conservative government or even opting for new elections – the least popular choice among the German public, according to polls.
Many SPD members fiercely believe the party’s poor standing at the last vote had much to do with its inability to distinguish itself from the conservative alliance after years in government together.
Despite this, Schulz has the tacit backing of most party leaders – with some misgivings – and has also received considerable support from political leaders in Europe, who have urged him to be brave and step up for the sake of European stability.
The same appeal has come from Germany’s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a longtime party member, who encouraged Schulz to steer the party in the direction of government.
In several telephone calls, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, has urged Schulz to enter talks with Merkel and offered his support on the issue of European Union reforms. Macron is also greatly dependent on Merkel’s continuation in the role of chancellor if he is to have any solid support in the EU for his economic reform agenda.
The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has also sent Schulz supportive text messages; in one he pleaded with him to “not stand on the sidelines during this decisive phase for Europe”. Schulz has publicly welcomed their support.
The SPD will spend much of the next three days wrangling over the issue. Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU) are reportedly keen to pursue a deal, although some conservatives have urged leaders to also consider a minority government, with the support of the SPD.
Schulz has said any decision would first have to be put to the party’s rank and file in a vote, meaning that any exploratory talks could not begin before January, and any grand coalition that was agreed on would not be likely to come together before Easter.
And any stability brought by a grand coalition could well be offset by what many see as the unsettling scenario of the far-right populist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) becoming the leading opposition party in the Bundestag. Schulz burst onto the German political scene in January, after decades in Brussels, taking over as SPD leader after being voted in with 100 per cent support, and igniting the 150 year old party with a new spirit after years of poor poll ratings and falling election results. But his political star waned after just a few months. Not only did Schulz singularly fail to promote the characteristics that distinguish his party from Merkel’s conservatives, but like all of the established parties, the SPD also haemorrhaged hundreds of thousands of supporters to the AfD."

The leader of Germany’s Social Democratic party has denied reports that he has green-lighted talks about another “grand coalition” with Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats.
“The reports are plainly and simply wrong,” the SPD leader, Martin Schulz, said on Friday after claims in the German newspaper Bild that the two parties had agreed to begin exploratory talks on a new coalition following a meeting with the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, on Thursday.
The newspaper said the participants – Merkel, her Bavarian ally Horst Seehofer and Schulz – had discussed various options for forming a government, including a grand coalition, setting up a minority government under Merkel, or holding new elections. But they ultimately agreed to start talks about a rerun of the conservative coalition.
Merkel is casting around for a coalition partner after her centre-right bloc shed support to the far right in the 24 September election. Her attempts to form a three-way tie-up with the pro-business Free Democratic party (FDP) and the Greens failed.
Schulz insisted his party would continue to talk about all options, which could include tolerating a Merkel minority government, possibly in tandem with the Green party. He added that he had called the chancellor to complain about “inacceptable” leaks to the press.
Whether the SPD is prepared to go all the way towards a coalition agreement with Merkel remains unclear. Schulz fronts a party which is split evenly down the middle on what he should do next.
“We need big ideas for our country,” said Manuela Schwesig, the state premier of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and a former family minister. “As before, I remain sceptical that you can do that by carrying on ‘business as usual’ in a grand coalition.”
The youth branch of the SPD is organising a petition which rejects a third grand coalition under Merkel and advocates that the centre-left should tolerate a Christian Democrat minority government instead. “We remain clear: the SPD’s rejection of a continued grand coalition was mandatory and right,” says the petition."

If I was a cow being led to an abattoir and the boss offered me a stake in the business, the first question I would ask is: are you going to stop killing us? Sadly, this was not the first question the leader of Germany’s Social Democratic party (SPD), Martin Schulz, asked after Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the president of Germany, made a “dramatic appeal” for the centre-left party to join Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats in a grand coalition. Instead, the answer was: “Let me consult my colleagues.”
If, as is likely, the SPD’s membership tells Schulz to rejoin Merkel to stabilise Germany, the only prediction one can make is that the price they demand to save her bacon will not be high.
At the core of the crisis are the 94 MPs elected to the Bundestag from the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) – which has come from nowhere to be the third largest party. So far, they have used their platform to demand Syrian refugees be sent home, and to ostentatiously show support for the German military, which, for historically obvious reasons, is kept out of parliamentary politics. The Bundestag platform, from which extreme language has been absent since the Federal Republic’s foundation, is now a megaphone for the AfD’s racism and Islamophobia.
If coalition talks go nowhere and Merkel has to go for new elections, it would be enough for the AfD to deliver the same result again to cement its position as the revolutionary force in German politics. It would also confirm something no friend of Germany wants to say, but which has to be said: that disconcertingly large numbers of Germans are prone to the modern equivalent of fascism.
A system designed after 1945 to guarantee a two-party centrist consensus has failed to do so. While both the Greens and the radical left Die Linke were successfully absorbed into the parliamentary system, stabilising at between 6% and 10%, the AfD burst through at the first opportunity to score 14% – and this in a country boasting record low unemployment and high levels of social welfare. And many believe the AfD would do even better in new elections.
In the east-central state of Thuringia, where the AfD scored up to 27% in some districts, the leftists and social democrats I met last month were worried. It is not just, or even mainly, the poverty of the old East Germany that has driven people there towards the right: it is resistance to change. The AfD’s base here is middle-class, driven by resistance to migration, to modernisation, to the gradual encroachment of global brands on to suburban Germany’s folksy high streets, and, above all, to further European integration.
The AfD is not classically fascist – and does not need to be. Hitler needed his stormtroopers to take on and defeat the most organised labour movement, and biggest communist party, in Europe – and he did so amid double-digit unemployment. But to construct the essential alliance between the “elite and the mob” – as Hannah Arendt described it – the AfD just needs to go on normalising hate-speech, recruiting well-heeled people from business and the military, and disrupting the status quo.
The centrist Germany of the university campus, the gentrified suburb and the technocratic workplace veers between complacency and fear. Most people I talk to start out saying: “It will all be OK,” and, after a few beers, admit the stomach-clenching possibility that it will not. Berlin, above all, is a city where every old building resonates, if you Google diligently enough, with bad historical vibes; where enough of the past survives to know that in these rooms and on the stairways of now-trendified blocks of flats, the most unspeakable crimes of the 20th century were perpetrated.
So, what should Schulz do? As the price for a new grand coalition, he must demand that Merkel’s party commits to a programme of deficit-led growth, a huge investment programme, an end to the offshoring of industrial jobs to eastern Europe and re-engagement with Emmanuel Macron’s plan for European integration. Germany should end its rearguard actions against expansionary monetary policy in Europe and coordinate a fiscal stimulus to the eurozone periphery on the scale of a Marshall plan. That would be worth propping up Merkel for, but nothing else.
One of the biggest problems with the rest of the G7’s engagement with Germany has been the refusal to acknowledge a problem with the elites that is well known to the German left: their attachment to a rules-based idea of freedom combined with a tendency to make romantic gestures when the rules don’t work. Merkel’s response to the refugee crisis of 2015, and indeed her attempt to expel Greece from the eurozone in the same year, both exemplify a level of unpredictability that the rest of Europe has been too polite to mention.
Although the last time Germany failed to form a government was in the Weimar republic, the parallels here are not with the 1920s. Instead, they are with Austria in 2017. Austrian voters handed victory to a rightwing nationalist conservative demagogue, who is trying to patch up a coalition with the far right. If the German socialists can’t get Merkel to engage with their policy, they should stay out of coalition with her party. If Merkel can envisage forming a minority government, so could the SPD, with the support of the Greens and the radical left. In all three parties, those with imagination should be laying the basis now for a red-red-green coalition that ends neoliberal economics in Germany.
The German electorate needs more cards on the table than continuity v rightwing revolution. The only thing that’s going to bury the AfD is an alternative for the people, for internationalism, for the active embrace of multicultural values and refugee support – and for social justice."

Suddenly Germany, famed for its political stability, betrayed a new vulnerability last week. Or so some would have you believe. One of the tragedies of modern Britain is the implosion of the political centre. And without the ballast of a strong centre, we are steadily losing the capacity to think straight.
This was a case in point. Chancellor Merkel’s attempts to build a coalition government fell apart. Eurosceptic liberals and green ultras could not agree a programme for government with her Christian Democrats. The British right gloated at the prospect: this was the moment to exact better terms in the Brexit negotiations from a mortally wounded Germany now suddenly brought to earth.
It was thinking far removed from any reality. Germany is neither politically nor economically mortally wounded. Yes, there is a major political crisis following a hung election, but Germany will find a way through, rather more satisfactorily than stuffing a tiny minority party with a billion-pound bribe, as the Tories did with the Democratic Unionists. Its political system requires its principal parties to keep on talking to each other if none can command an overall parliamentary majority; they have their ideologies, but tempered by the necessity of dialogue to form a potential programme for government. A resolution will be found, or another election called, with the electorate more keenly aware of the choices they are making. It is democracy by grownups.
That is what is happening. German Social Democrats, after an impassioned plea by the president to put public before party interest, will poll their members about the terms for creating a possible coalition with Merkel’s Christian Democrats. There will be enormous wariness: junior partners in coalitions don’t fare well in either Germany or Britain, but Merkel will be going cap in hand to her left-of-centre rivals as her last option. For them, it could be the opportunity to put the social firmly back in Germany’s social market economy.
The economic backdrop to the negotiations could scarcely be more benign. Germany is beginning to grow strongly. Meanwhile, the eurozone, derided in Britain for its sclerosis, austerity, social cruelty, unsustainability and imminent collapse, is growing at the fastest rate for 10 years. German unemployment is lower than in Britain, and not achieved by many of those in work suffering stagnating real wages and insecurity. Germany has a strong budgetary surplus; there is huge scope to increase its already formidable economic competitiveness by stepping up its spending across new technology. It is not Britain that is going to be at the centre of the latest European industrial revolution, but Germany and France.
Yet none of this intrudes into our insular political debate. Germany is not about to capitulate to British demands to be cut a special deal on Brexit so that we can enjoy all the trade and market access benefits of EU membership without any of the responsibilities. Why would any German politician want that? Why would they need to? We are the supplicant country in desperate and growing trouble, if only we could see it.
That was the message of last week’s budget. The Office for Budget Responsibility projects that economic growth over the next five years will average 1.4%, an unprecedented, brutal downward revision of its forecasts. Productivity is projected to grow at a snail’s pace, so there is virtually no growth in earnings adjusted for inflation. It is the bleakest official forecast I can remember.
Nor does it capture all the risks. Sir Ivan Rogers, UK representative to the EU between 2013 and 2017 – in his lecture at the Hertford College series on prime ministers and Europe on Friday evening (full disclosure: I am Principal at Hertford, Oxford) – predicted the only feasible Brexit trade deal would be one based in principle on the Canadian free trade agreement, but which could take up to a decade to negotiate in legal detail. This, along with the absence of other trade agreements, which will take equally long to negotiate, would represent such a shock to British trade flows that he thought it would topple the UK into a full-blown recession. As shocking was his revelation that some leading Brexiters were fully aware of the economic risks, but wanted to organise the pain so it comes early rather than later in the run-up to a 2022 general election.
The chancellor, Philip Hammond, one of the few remaining substantial centrist British political figures, knows all this. But to acknowledge it openly would, given the current state of the Conservative party, cost him his political life. He would be confirmed as the pessimistic, unpatriotic Eeyore working against the will of the people. Instead, he has to talk of the opportunity ahead, and how the performance of the UK economy “continues to confound those who seek to talk it down”. It is rubbish, as well he knows. But the atmosphere does not permit the truth to be said. Britain remains the exceptional country that is going to get an exceptional deal congruent with its exceptional destiny.
British exceptionalism is a national delusion, and a shaft of light is that it is gradually being dispelled. Our economic performance is woeful, to be cruelly exposed when outside the EU. And there is an emerging consensus about the need for an industrial strategy both to support more fast-growing, knowledge-intensive firms and to try to close Britain’s huge geographical inequalities.
Milton Keynes, with half Liverpool’s population, produces the same volume of goods and services. For all its political weakness, the government is set to launch an industrial strategy white paper tomorrow – reinforced by Hammond earmarking another £2.3bn for research and development in 2021 and £7bn for the productivity fund in 2022. Jam tomorrow, maybe, and years behind what is happening in Europe and China, but a welcome signal of a new direction of travel.
It is the beginning of thinking straighter, but too many cling to Britain’s alleged exceptionalism, firing up so many Brexiters. The question in British politics is how soon the economic severity of what lies ahead will change minds – and whether exceptionalism can survive 20 years of wage stagnation, recession, stasis and the inevitable setback in house prices. It is not Germany that is the sick man of Europe, the cherished belief of the Brexiters, but Britain. Real change, even recommitting to Europe, will follow that growing realisation."

Danyal Bayaz has experienced many things during his first few weeks as a new MP, but boredom is not one of them. Two months after entering Germany’s parliament as a Green party candidate, Bayaz, 34, from Heidelberg, has watched rightwing politicians give each other standing ovations for Eurosceptic diatribes, leftwingers heckle the far right as racists and a former climate activist with dyed hair form unlikely alliances with Christian Democrats in tailored suits.
Last week Bayaz saw the dramatic collapse of coalition talks that would have seen his Green colleagues catapulted into government and now faces the possibility that his seat may come up for grabs again in fresh elections next spring. “Right now I am not even sure if it’s worth me getting a loyalty card here,” he quips as he orders a cappuccino in the Bundestag’s canteen.
For years, German politics were both mocked and admired for being too uneventful to the point of tedium. Only recently the lack of drama inside the reconstructed Reichstag’s circular plenary chamber led to calls for a more confrontational, Westminster-style approach. But as old geopolitical certainties have crumbled over the past 18 months, Berlin’s consensual, unexcitable style of policymaking has won new admirers.
The collapse of talks to form the next coalition government have exposed Angela Merkel’s diminished authority. Many are now beginning to wonder if the division wrought on Britain and the US by Brexit and Donald Trump has also descended on Europe’s biggest economy.
With Merkel’s last coalition partners, the Social Democratic party (SPD) and the Free Democrats (FDP), more eager on parliamentary opposition than on government posts, and an already ultra-oppositional Alternative für Deutschland hoping to receive a further boost from the political standstill, commentators in Germany have started to evoke the darkest days of the Weimar Republic, when short-lived minority governments ruled by emergency decrees.
“Like in Weimar, the federal republic is now a multiparty system in which extreme parties have begun to paralyse the working of the parliamentary democracy,” wrote Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-German relations.
Right now I am not even sure if it’s worth me getting a loyalty card in the Bundestag canteen
“Germany’s obsession with stability was largely a result of reforms aimed at avoiding the mistakes of the Weimar Republic,” said Anthony Glees, a historian at the University of Buckingham. “In spite of a proportional vote system, a 5% threshold for smaller parties guaranteed that postwar Germany was for decades a two-party state, where the power would lie safely in the centre.”
With polls for possible fresh elections next year predicting that both Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union and the SDP could drop below 30% while support for the FDP, the AfD, the Greens and the Left party continues to grow, Glees said, “that system is now biting Germany in the leg”.
Many historians warn of hastily drawn comparisons, however. “What’s wrong with Germany becoming more like multiparty democracies in the Netherlands or Scandinavia?” asked Andreas Schulz, a researcher on the history of German parliamentarianism.
Merkel has announced she is sceptical about forming a minority government, either on her own or with the Green party, which would have to form majorities with other parties vote by vote. But Schulz said the traumatic experience of seeing minority governments collapse and allow the rise of Adolf Hitler obscured the fact that minority governments worked efficiently elsewhere in Europe and even at a German state level. As the centre-left SPD is waking up to the potential cost of new elections and mulls over tolerating a minority government, it is possible that Merkel could eventually come to agree.
“The way the Bundestag had managed to integrate first the Green party in the 1980s and then the Left party at the start of the new millennium shows that our parliamentary system can adapt to new parties,” Schulz said.
“We sometimes forget that the Weimar Republic only had 10 years to mature and develop,” said Thomas Mergel, a historian at Berlin’s Humboldt University. Even during its short existence it had shown that a parliamentary system could teach the most intransigent political party the value of coalition forming, he argued.
In the 1920s and 30s, parliamentarians started to lose the ability to find compromises only once the Great Depression wreaked havoc with the German economy. New parliamentarians such as Bayaz are concerned that Germany’s new populist right could be quicker at learning to exploit the polarised political landscape than established parties.
The last week has seen delegates of anti-immigration AfD take their seats in parliament wearing yellow ribbons on their suit jackets, in what the party described a gesture of solidarity with Germany’s armed forces. On Twitter, AfD MPs claimed that the “old parties” had left their seats half vacant during a debate on the military – a claim which was later disputed.
Another debate saw conservatives, liberals, environmentalists and leftwingers join forces to oppose an AfD suggestion that Syrian refugees should be sent back to their homeland since Islamic State had “almost been beaten” and security levels “substantially improved” in the country. The motion was soundly defeated, but the rightwing newcomers had found their stage.
Bayaz is nevertheless optimistic that a livelier Bundestag can have its upsides. “There is a new pluralism in the debating chamber,” he said. “Parties are not as easy to keep apart as they used to be.”
The son of a German mother and a Turkish father with a PhD on financial markets, Bayaz said he would have enjoyed a conservative-liberal-green “Jamaica” coalition that cut through old political certainties. With his smart navy suit and short hair, he has in his first weeks already been mistaken by the press for a member of the FDP and drawn confused looks from the rightwing populists. It is not impossible to conceive that newcomers like Bayaz could end up ushering in a German minority government after all.
One of the hangovers of the Weimar Republic is that a president cannot call a snap election without making parliament vote in a chancellor first. The assumption is that a chancellor Merkel, who has not organised a governing coalition, would fail to gain a majority in such a vote. New MPs who have only just started to find a taste for their life in politics, from whatever party, may have a different idea.
Born amid the chaos following the first world war, the Weimar Republic lasted, unofficially, from 1919 to 1933 and struggled to cope with extremism, hyperinflation and resentment at Germany’s treatment by the war’s victors. In order to reduce political conflicts, a proportional representation system was adopted, leading to a series of coalitions that struggled to govern. Political violence was endemic. By 1923, there had been 376 political assassinations. US loans helped recovery from 1924 to 1929, but the Wall Street crash led to recall of the loans and the start of a new economic crisis, rising unemployment and dissatisfaction with mainstream parties. In January 1933 the president, Paul von Hindenburg, appointed Nazi party leader Adolf Hitler chancellor. That year, after the Reichstag fire, Hitler seized absolute power and Germany became a fascist dictatorship."

Martin Schulz, the leader of Germany’s Social Democratic party, has said he will not stand in the way of his party forming a “grand coalition” with Angela Merkel’s conservatives, signalling a potential end to a lengthy deadlock over the formation of a new German government.
Schulz, who has persistently expressed his opposition to the continuation of a leftwing-conservative alliance, insisting German voters clearly showed their opposition to it at elections on 24 September when they gave the SPD its worst result since the second world war, has said he wants party members to be polled on the issue first.
Schulz was summoned to the office of the president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, on Thursday evening for an emergency meeting to discuss how to avoid new elections following a collapse of coalition talks between Merkel’s CDU/CSU alliance, the pro-business FDP and the Greens last weekend.
Steinmeier had delivered a “dramatic appeal” to him, Schulz said, to drop his opposition to being part of a coalition, for the good of national stability.
Following Schulz’s meeting with Steinmeier, the SPD leadership met at party headquarters on Thursday evening for hours of talks which went on late into the night leaving Germany on tenterhooks.
German politics has been plunged into several days of uncertainty following the collapse of the talks, which broke down over issues related to the refugee crisis and environmental policies. The stalemate, Merkel’s biggest political crisis of her 12 years in office, has prompted speculation that a prolonged power vacuum in the continent’s largest economy could trigger instability across Europe.
Schulz signalled on Twitter on Friday afternoon that he would not ignore the president’s appeal. “Should this lead to us participating in whatever form in the formation of a government, the SPD’s members will take a vote on this,” he wrote.
Following the breakdown of talks aimed at forming a Jamaica coalition – so called because the participating parties’ colours resemble those of the Jamaican flag – the SPD has been under increasing pressure to back down from its previous insistence that it would not take part in a future government. Other options include a minority government, which the SPD has said it might be willing to support, or new elections, which all parties have insisted they wish to avoid.
Schulz said his party was not fixed on any of the solutions. “There’s no automatism [action without conscious intention] in any direction,” he said.
Steinmeier had earlier announced that he had invited Schulz, along with Angela Merkel and Horst Seehofer, the head of her Bavarian sister party, the CSU, for joint talks, which according to some sources will take place in the presidential palace, Bellvue, on Thursday.
The SPD has governed in coalition with Merkel since 2013. Polls have shown the electorate was largely against a repeat of the arrangement, but that following the breakdown of Jamaica talks, the idea has once more grown in favour."

Coalition talks have broken down between Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), the pro-business FDP and the Green party after German federal elections at the end of September.
Germany’s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, is urging party leaders to rethink their positions and try again to form a government. The centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), Merkel’s partners in the outgoing government, say they will not budge from their refusal to enter a new Merkel-led administration. If that stands, a minority government or new elections are the only options.
We asked voters in Germany to explain the situation as they see it and tell us how they hope the talks will play out.
Germany has a tradition of coalition governments. And we have a strong constitution with good checks and balances, so nobody has to fear anything from this situation. German democracy is not under threat.
The current government will stay in charge until a solution is found. Either Merkel continues to govern with a minority in parliament, or she is looking for a different coalition setup and tries again, or we will have new elections. All of our states have state-governments that are functioning, so we are far away from chaos.
The FDP and Greens are definitely bunglers. Both parties have some good visions and ideas, but it’s either the lack of designing policies in an acceptable way or a lack of responsibility for the whole country. The FDP is famous for catering to their special clientele like doctors, lawyers, and treating everyone else like morons. I haven’t seen anything as amateurish as them for long time. Voting for Die Linke or AfD [Alternative für Deutschland] in my mind is totally irresponsible. But as they are a reality, I likewise don’t understand why the established parties don’t want to talk to them. It’s 20% of voters and it’s a mistake to ignore them.
The only option left for me is currently the CDU, even though I don’t always like their policies. I really hate Martin Schulz. He should resign as a politician. The SPD is full of much better talent.
I was not happy about Merkel’s decision to open our borders in such an uncontrolled manner. This was her single biggest mistake. It was not a mistake to offer generous help to Syrian refugees. But there are other ways this could have been done. I don’t support the approach that people can come to Europe without being checked and having no passports. I think she is one of the best politicians in the world. She is very clear in her thinking and a very rational leader who focuses on keeping Germany out of trouble.
We have low unemployment, a solid constitution, no undemocratic forces in the parliament or a strong army with a non-democratic agenda. Germany is well embedded into the international community and not an isolated country any longer.
It’s a new situation that we didn’t have for 70 years, but our constitution is robust and we will have stability and there will be a government. All parties need to come to their senses and they will. Some politicians simply will grow up.
I support Die Linke and the Greens, though I feel conflicted about the latter, especially considering the fact they are willing to form coalitions with the CDU and, worse, CSU, which I feel shows they have moved far from their original leftist, perhaps even socialist, founding ideals.
I think there are many valid criticisms of Merkel, but I do respect her much more since she opened the borders in summer 2015. She’s definitely preferable to many other members of her party, and virtually everyone in the CSU (not to mention AfD) but she is still a member of her party.
I was looking forward to a new coalition taking over from the stale grand coalition, despite the fact that I am almost diametrically opposed to the CSU and FDP and find the CDU barely tolerable. On the other hand, new elections could lead to entirely different, and perhaps better, coalition opportunities, though I also fear that the AfD might gain in strength, which is the worst possible outcome.
I hope there will be new elections and that these result in gains for leftist parties, perhaps even leading to a red-green or even red-red-green coalition, while the AfD and FDP – now that it has become clearer how unwilling either are to work for the German people – get less than 5% of votes again and don’t enter the Bundestag.
Of course, I don’t consider any of that particularly likely, but one can hope.
Martin Schulz’s refusal to enter another government with the CDU was a stupid move. Had he not been so strong in his comments, he could have returned as a knight in shining armour to save Germany from international embarrassment and help unify the country. Maybe with a little help from the Greens.
The FDP had no intention of joining the Jamaica coalition [CDU/CSU/FDP/Green] in the first place. I think this is all grandstanding to position FDP as a CDU/CSU contender and sideline the SPD. FDP is just a thinly veiled, more civilised version of AfD; it is not a liberal party. Merkel will hit back at FDP, deservedly, for their little strategy play. All other parties are bit-part players.
I’m a green atheist, so the CDU isn’t my cup of tea, but Merkel is a star politician and a voice of reason. Sure, she could be more progressive, and make Germany a little less bureaucratic, but all in all a world-class leader. Martin Schultz is as interesting as a brick.
In a likely re-election, nothing much will happen. The SPD will lose some votes to the CDU and Greens. The FDP will get some votes from AfD. So in a few months we’ll be more or less in the same situation. The SPD will be most hurt.
I trust that we will manage the situation but I am far from pleased. I am somewhat disturbed by the decline of the two big parties – the CDU and SPD. The SPD seems rudderless right now.
Our two largest parties worked together and both lost in the process. The fringe parties got too strong, so that none of the coalitions we are accustomed to are possible. And a new grand coalition would worsen the situation in the long run.
I wish the pro-business FDP had shown a bit more responsibility. I hope either for a Jamaica coalition or a new election, which would probably be in spring 2018. This is enough time for the people to reorient themselves.
I really wanted not to vote for Angela Merkel, because an eternal chancellor is not healthy for our democracy. But the alternative was not very convincing. She is a great chancellor. I like that she remains calm and that she does not give in to the politicians’ urge to please the media. She is smart and she is modest in her personal life. We are lucky to have her. But all good things have to end sometime.
The German thing about the mess is that we are only experiencing a mere shadow of the type of crisis other nations are accustomed to.

Germany’s president will meet with the leader of the Social Democrats today as the centre left faces growing pressure to consider talks about a centrist coalition with Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats to avoid fresh elections in 2018.
Martin Schulz, the leader of the Social Democratic party (SPD), ruled out another “grand coalition” after his party’s worst postwar performance in federal elections in September. He reiterated his stance after the collapse on Sunday of talks about a three-way coalition between the CDU, the Free Democratic party (FDP) and the Greens.
But Germany’s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a fellow Social Democrat, will appeal to Schulz to reconsider at a meeting between the two on Thursday. There is speculation that the SPD leader could face calls to step aside at a party conference in two weeks’ time if he refuses to change his stance.
The FDP’s walkout from coalition talks on Sunday night has thrown politics in Germany into a state of paralysis, described by Steinmeier as “a situation that the German federal republic … has never seen before”.
While postwar Germany has been ruled for periods by minority governments and snap elections have been called before, there has never been a comparable struggle to form a government directly after an election.
The national poll on 24 September showed a pronounced splintering of the vote, with six parties crowding into the Bundestag’s plenary chamber for the first time since the introduction of a 5% vote-share hurdle for parliamentary seats in 1953.
Merkel has indicated that she would prefer fresh elections over a minority government and would be willing to run again as her party’s candidate. While German media are in part attributing the collapse of the so-called “Jamaica” talks to a flaw in Merkel’s approach, support for the chancellor in the CDU has solidified after Sunday’s drama and a leadership challenge is unlikely.
Schulz’s position in the SPD is less stable. Like the FDP, the party is nervous about entering into another “grand coalition” with Merkel as a junior partner: its previous two partnerships in 2005-09 and 2013-17 were punished at the voting booth.
“We don’t want Austrian conditions,” said one of the SPD’s deputy leaders, Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, pointing at the political situation in Germany’s southern neighbour, where years of grand coalition rule have enabled the rise of a far-right party.
But many politicians on the centre left are equally nervous about further elections, which would not only hurt the SPD’s finances but could also result in a diminished share of the vote and more seats for the rightwing populist Alternative für Deutschland.
At a party group meeting on Monday, Schulz tried to pass a resolution affirming his position that the SPD was “not available for entering a grand coalition” and “not scared of fresh elections”, but ended up facing protests from more than 30 delegates who questioned its unambiguous language.
The party group leader Andrea Nahles afterwards hinted that the SPD could consider tolerating a minority government made up either of just Merkel’s party or a CDU-Green coalition: a solution that would run an even greater risk of allowing a conservative chancellor to take credit for social democratic ideas, however.
Another rumoured solution to the political deadlock – whereby grand coalition talks could be started only if Merkel, Schulz and the Christian Social Union leader, Horst Seehofer, all resigned – is unlikely to have any sympathisers among the CDU.
Already, there is speculation in the German press that the SPD party conference in two weeks’ time is likely to see Schulz make way for a new chancellor candidate or a new party leader, mooted to be either Manuela Schwesig, a former minister for family, or Olaf Scholz, the mayor of Hamburg.
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung suggested that the only way out for Schulz, a former president of the European parliament, would be to drop his election-night promise and kickstart coalition talks with Merkel.
“He could show the FDP what taking responsibility means,” said the centre-right broadsheet. “And he could demonstrate his instinct to show that his European moment has come.”"

Suddenly Brexit matters, a lot. Until recently I had regarded it as one of those crises that we muddle through somehow, like the bank collapse or the winter of discontent. Time is the great compromiser. Project fear would turn out to be project not-quite-as-bad-as-we-thought.
Hovering over Brexit was Angela Merkel, goddess of common sense. We were told that the implacable Michel Barnier in Brussels was always “waiting for the nod from Berlin”. Autocratic German bankers might screw the eurozone. But there was always Minerva Merkel, the rock, pragmatic towards Russia, tough towards Greece, welcoming to refugees, tightfisted with money.
The rock has crumbled. The allies’ postwar crafting of Germany’s constitution, to nobble it with coalitions, has turned sour. Overnight, Merkel makes Britain’s Theresa May seem positively secure. We have no idea what leadership may ensue in Berlin, and so no idea what may lie in store for the EU. There couldn’t be a worse time for Britain to upset the apple-cart.
Britons are cursed to remember too much, but sometimes they do not remember enough. Throughout history, peace in Europe has relied on equilibrium, on a balance of power between the many member states. Every great conflict in the continent’s history has resulted from an upsetting of this equilibrium – for the past 150 years by Germany.
Britain was never part of this balance. It is an island, sufficient unto itself. When, during the hundred years war, it tried to become a European power, it made a mess of it, and never tried again. Henry VIII oversaw the first Brexit in 1534, detaching Britain from the authority of Roman Catholic Europe. Tudors, Stuarts and Hanoverians carefully absented themselves from Europe’s vicious wars of religion and succession. Through the settlements of Westphalia, Utrecht and Vienna, Britain notionally supported the balance of power, but her chief interest lay in a trading empire.
Hence Robert Walpole’s proud boast in 1734: “There are 50,000 men slain this year in Europe, and not one an Englishman.” Lord John Russell disbanded most of the British army after Waterloo, to avoid “turning a naval into a military nation, a mighty island into a petty continental state”. After the rise of Bismarck, the Tory Lord Salisbury in the 1890s preached “splendid isolation”, with Britain “drifting lazily downstream, putting out a boat-hook occasionally to avoid collision”.
In other words, Britain has been Brexiting since the 16th century. But sometimes the Brexit did not last. Salisbury’s boat-hook soon became a mighty army. Britain’s wars against Germany in the 20th century were to redress an upset in the balance of power. It was in this pan-European spirit that Britain joined Nato and later the Common Market. It accepted that geography meant a commitment to Europe’s strategic and economic space – albeit rarely as a full-hearted member of the EU. It seems to have been content to leave Germany in charge.
Now Germany wobbles and it is dangerous. A month before the Brexit referendum, I attended a conference in Berlin of German politicians and commentators. They pleaded with us not to vote Brexit, for a surprising reason: “Don’t leave us in charge.” Germany, they said, was not yet a mature democracy. It was already too powerful. German politicians had fashioned the eurozone to benefit their banks and blight poor countries. Nationalists on the far right were resurgent everywhere.
I usually discount such short-term histrionics, but not now. Like any chancellor, Merkel has been walking on eggshells. She has been weak on the EU and on eurozone reform. She has headed an EU that has become so unpopular that no other European leader would dare ask Britain’s referendum question. Now Merkel herself seems on the way out.
As a result, in the clouds beyond we can see only the surging identity politics of nationalism, whether in Spain, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic or north Italy. War was once politics by other means. Now the converse may be the case, and thank goodness. But there is such a thing as dangerous politics. The centre is not holding. Leaders are digging into their national subconscious to unearth, if not guns, then a means to populist power.
The times when Britain has been summoned to “come to the aid of Europe” have been few. But they have been preceded by British blindness towards a sudden shift in politics on the continent. When the Catholic church, Louis XIV or Napoleon threatened the peace of Europe, Britain hesitated. It might send a Marlborough or a Wellington to fly the flag for British soldiering, but its heart was rarely in it.
The same casualness infuses the present Brussels negotiations. It may be dismaying to see the EU’s Barnier treat David Davis as might a counter-reformation cardinal some pesky Lutheran princeling. Barnier clearly cares nothing for Europe, only for the Holy Brussels Church and its budget. But in response Britain seems devoid of interest. It shows no vision of an endgame, as if it did not mind about Brexit either way. This is precisely how Europe slithered to war in centuries past.
Europe is not going to war. But its internal-government relations are ever more brittle. The prospect is of another credit crunch, the crippling of the Greek economy, mass unemployment in Italy and Spain, and a critical need for a deal with Russia.
Europe needs a leader. If Merkel is not to be one, then who? Surely not the egotistical Emmanuel Macron? It would have been a golden opportunity for Britain to seize the helm, if only it had not abandoned ship.
Britain has clearly to proceed with Brexit. But it must get the item off the negotiating table as soon as possible. It should seek a quickie divorce: pay the money and marry Norway. It could then hurl itself into a revived “concert of Europe”, and convince the EU’s council of ministers to convene a conference on reform. There could then be a fresh start, a new treaty for a future Europe of sovereign states. That is the treaty Britain can help to write and join, starting now.

Petra Leitholdt was far from enthusiastic about the prospect of new elections in Germany. “It’s just a waste of time, energy and resources,” the 51-year-old said, standing on the bustling market square of Hermannplatz in the Neukölln district of Berlin.
“I for one wouldn’t vote any differently than I did on September 24. I weighed up my options then and would make the same decision if there was another vote. But I think Angela Merkel will come out on top again anyway, although maybe strengthened.”
Her mother, Irmgard, 80, nodded furiously. Her arm looped into her daughter’s as they made their way home, the two said they enjoyed talking about politics but felt it had failed their neighbourhood and Germany as a whole.
“Under Merkel, inequality has risen, the gap between rich and poor is getting wider, child poverty is on the rise and there’s been no real effort put into trying to control rents in this area, which makes life really tough for many,” said Irmgard. “I don’t think Merkel is to blame for that, but I also don’t think she has much say over what happens. Democracy is very flawed.”
Petra Leitholdt hoped nevertheless that the shock to Merkel of having to stand again if new elections were called might “make her think more about interests at home. I get such a strong impression of a leader who is there for Europe but not really for the Germans. Maybe that would change.”
Achim (not his real name) drew on a cigarette and took a sip of his pils outside a newsagents on Karl-Marx-Strasse. The farmer turned visa administrator, 57, said German elections always made him nervous. “You just cannot trust the Germans, as history has shown,” he said. “I think they are the most intelligent sheep in the world. I constantly worry what Germany might unleash on the world, particularly with Britain leaving the EU, which just gives Germany more power in Europe. And I fear what might happen in this current climate of uncertainty if Merkel is unseated.”
He was a strong advocate of Merkel, although he said that did not necessarily mean he voted for her. He said he could not imagine a better leader for Germany.
“Of course she’s made mistakes,” he said. “The refugee decision was right morally but wrong politically – it was too much of a churchy thing for her to do. And it has got her into the mess she’s in now. But with all the drama going on in the rest of the world – from Saudi Arabia to Russia, Turkey to Syria, the US to Britain – she’s absolutely the calm hand we need, and I’d hope she’ll get re-elected.”
Timothy, 32, who did not want to give his surname, said he was ill informed about politics. “But I feel the potential turmoil that could follow if Germany is plunged into political uncertainty,” he said, buying a coffee. “For Europe and for Germany. Germany is being seen as a bit of a political anchor and that could be in danger.”
Wiping up his coffee bar, a converted VW camper van, Hassan, 37, a recent arrival from Turkey via the US with his German wife, said he was happy to have been able to make a life for his family in Germany. “It’s stable, it’s social, and even the large amount of bureaucracy one has to deal with I appreciate because it’s a sign that politics has control.” He too appreciated the calm hand of Merkel – “she’s very self-controlled, she doesn’t give into machos like Putin and Erdogan” – and feared what might come after her.
“I feel safe and secure now, but imagine if [the far-right populists] Alternative für Deutschland were to get into power on the back of the political mess we have now. Then where might that leave me and my family?”
Samiha Bagdadi, 47, a service worker, said she too feared a sharpening in tone of anti-foreigner rhetoric. “Fundamentally the world needs a huge political rethink,” she said, pushing her bike home from work on Karl-Marx-Strasse. “But at least under Merkel I think the country is polite and decent, though I fear the powers working behind the scenes, and I fear who might govern Germany if she is no longer in power. We’ve seen what’s happened in the US, and how people’s language and behaviour is being shaped by Donald Trump. Well, I fear a German Trump. Or worse. I think people are susceptible to that.”"

The collapse of Germany’s coalition talks is the latest shock to hit Europe. No one saw it coming. Of course the blow is of a different nature from the banking crisis, the war in Ukraine, the refugee crisis, Brexit, Trump, Poland and Hungary’s democratic backsliding, or Catalan secessionism. Germany’s politics look upended but the fundamentals are still in place: the postwar democratic set-up is hardly under threat. Still, this is rattling stuff. Europe’s powerhouse is in unknown political territory at a time when so much remains unresolved across the continent. And Germany’s political uncertainty means yet more uncertainty for the EU. Yet doomsayers shouldn’t assume that this crisis has to be fatal.
Nowhere outside Germany is the political breakdown being watched more closely than in France. Emmanuel Macron had set his sights on the German election as the starting point of his plan for a European “renaissance” alongside Merkel. On Monday, Macron did not hide his concern, saying it was not in France’s interest that “things become tense” in Germany. “We must move forward,” he added. But the worries go deeper than Germany’s internal problems. If Merkel was supposed to be the leader of the free world in the era of Trump and Brexit then what might the future look like without her? Far-right websites have been humming with glee at the news that Merkel has now run into deep difficulty.
There is little doubt about which forces might seek to capitalise on these events. Merkel has been a favourite punch bag for populists and extremists, left and right alike. Germany’s clout in Europe under her tenure has been much disparaged, not least by Putin and Trump. And the EU was meant to be “catching the winds in its sails” this year, as Jean-Claude Juncker said. But now what? The German crisis may or may not be solved through new elections, but to assess what it means for Europe, how Macron plays his cards will be a key factor.
Macron’s France is on a bit of a high these days, and pulling Europe out of a difficult decade is one of the president’s biggest ambitions. He has built up a close relationship with Merkel, and together they had announced a “plan” for Europe to be implemented once Merkel had overcome her election hurdle. The trouble now is the clock is ticking. After the summer of 2018 campaigning for the 2019 European parliament elections gets under way. That’s a key political moment for Macron, who wants his République En Marche party to somehow be replicated across Europe through transnational lists which would then fill the departing UK’s 73 seats. Add to this Italy’s elections – due early 2018 – with the populist, anti-migrant Five Star Movement worryingly strong, and it becomes obvious that Europe does not need this German impasse.
Another German election could delay everything for months on end: fixing the eurozone, resolving the future relationship with Britain, dealing with the Balkans, delivering on trade deals, regulating globalisation, saving the Paris climate accord, building up European defence, solving Ukraine and the rest of it. As Britain pulls out of Europe, the dynamics of the Franco-German alliance have become absolutely paramount. Macron needs Germany if he is to succeed in at least creating the impression that he can transform France into a trailblazing European power. Germany needs France to allay continental perceptions that it has become too domineering and is acting selfishly.
But let’s keep things in perspective. Germany remains a strong democracy. Its economy is thriving. The country’s anchoring in the EU is not in doubt. Its main political parties all agree on the need to preserve the European project which, as Konrad Adenauer said in the 1950s, would be the road to Germany’s rehabilitation and its wellbeing. Merkel has repeatedly said this year: “Germany can do well only if Europe does well.” No serious politician contradicted her.
To a degree, the current trouble says more about German provincialism than it does about German might or hubris, or indeed any debate in Germany on a grand design for the country’s future or for Europe as a whole. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German president, wasn’t wrong when he warned on Monday that concern would only grow among his neighbours if the leaders of Europe’s largest nation did not rise to their responsibilities.
Against that backdrop, Macron projects self-confidence while Merkel looks jaded. Yet Macron depends on the outcome in Germany more than anything else. At home, he has contained domestic opposition to his labour market reforms and his ratings are up. It is not good news for him that Merkel is now weakened. At the same time, talk of Merkel’s political demise has been going on since the 2015 refugee crisis, and yet she is still around.
Macron is now waiting to see how he can secure the benefits of a relationship he’s so keenly invested in. These questions aren’t just central to two political careers – one just starting, the other of almost record duration. They are central to a whole continent.

Germany’s president met party leaders on Tuesday after talks to form a new government between Angela Merkel’s conservative bloc, the left-leaning Greens and pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) broke down at the weekend.
The collapse of coalition talks poses the most serious threat to Merkel’s position since she became chancellor more than a decade ago.
The president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, has called on political leaders to rethink their positions and try again to form a government. Meetings with the leaders of the Greens and the FDP’s Christian Lindner were held on Tuesday. Neither party spoke after their meeting.
The centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) – Merkel’s partners in the outgoing government – say they will not budge from their refusal to enter a new Merkel administration. If that stands, a minority government or a new election are the only options.
Martin Schulz, head of the SPD, is due to meet Steinmeier on Thursday.
While German media are assigning at least some of the blame for the collapse of talks to the chancellor, Merkel has exuded calm over the last two days and appeared to have even consolidated her authority within her party.
According to the weekly newspaper Die Zeit, even Christian Democrat (CDU) members who have been openly critical of her course during the refugee crisis have praised Merkel’s conduct during the coalition talks. “Angela Merkel is prepared to stay. And her party is as united in supporting her as it hasn’t been in ages,” it reported.
A putsch in Merkel’s CDU looks less likely than in the Social Democrats, where some members are more open to the idea of another “grand coalition” than their leader, Martin Schulz.
Wolfgang Schäuble, the former finance minister, appeared to nod towards the Social Democrats on Tuesday when he appealed to all parties to take a constructive role in solving the deadlock. “Europe and many other states in the world are waiting for us”, said Schäuble, who is president of the German parliament.
Peter Altmaier, the acting finance minister and a close confidant of Merkel, called on the parties to not run away from their responsibility but “make forming a government the primary objective”.
Exploratory talks to form the next German government collapsed on Sunday night after the pro-business FDP walked out of marathon negotiations with the CDU, their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, and the Green party.
CDU and Green negotiators on Monday stressed the common ground that had emerged between the two parties during the weeks of talks and focused their criticism on the FDP leader.
Lindner left the talks on Sunday saying the parties involved had missed several self-prescribed deadlines to resolve differences on migration and energy policies, and had “no common vision for modernisation of the country”.
Merkel, who has led three coalitions since 2005, said she was very sceptical about ruling in a minority government and suggested she would stand again as a candidate if elections were called in the new year, telling the public broadcaster ARD she was “a woman who has responsibility and is prepared to take responsibility in the future”.
In the centre-right Die Welt newspaper, the commentator Thomas Schmid argued that the largest share of the blame for the government paralysis lay with the chancellor.
“She has spend weeks practising with her famously passive patience. She moderated. As far it is known, she did not add any of her own impulses to the talks or lend it momentum,” he said.
“The Merkel method has come to an end. There’s no alternative: until today, that has been her motto. It has allowed her to gain formidable victories, especially on the international stage. But both internationally and nationally it has driven a depoliticisation of politics that has become especially evidence in the parliament’s loss of purpose.”
While new elections look increasingly likely, they are not expected to be called for another month. Germany’s constitution requires the president to nominate a chancellor for approval by the German parliament, the Bundestag. Only when no stable government can be formed after three rounds of voting there would the president ask Germans to return to the polls.
Over the next two to three weeks there will further talks between parties to explore whether another governing constellation is possible on the basis of the September vote.
Merkel’s problem is that even fresh elections in 2018 may not yield a more dynamic result. Snap polling on Monday indicated a broadly similar outcome to the September vote, with only the Greens profiting from the events of the last month: a survey by polling institute Insa has the party on 12%, up from 8.9% in September.
The collapse in the talks and possibility of fresh elections brings further uncertainty for the British government over Brexit. It had hoped that a strong German coalition, including the FDP, might help smooth the next phase of negotiations.
Prolonged uncertainty in Berlin will also raise concerns in France, where Emmanuel Macron was hoping that a strong German government would help with his plans for eurozone reforms. “It is not in France’s interest for things to get blocked,” the French president said at the start of a meeting with Bernard Accoyer, a leader of France’s opposition Les Républicains party.
Steinmeier previously appealed for German politicians to think of Europe as he called for coalition talks to resume. “There would be incomprehension and great concern inside and outside our country, and particularly in our European neighbourhood, if the political forces in the biggest and economically strongest country in Europe, of all places, didn’t fulfil their responsibility,” he said."

Angela Merkel has indicated that she would rather have fresh elections than try to rule in a minority government as the collapse of German coalition talks posed the most serious threat to her power since she became chancellor more than a decade ago.
Merkel, who has headed three coalitions since 2005, said she was “very sceptical” about ruling in a minority government and suggested she would stand again as a candidate if elections were called in the new year, telling public broadcaster ARD she was “a woman who has responsibility and is prepared to take responsibility in the future”.

Germany’s president had earlier urged political parties to resume efforts to a build a governing coalition following a meeting with Merkel. “I expect the parties to make the formation of a new government possible in the foreseeable future,” Frank-Walter Steinmeier said, adding that the parties had a responsibility that “cannot be simply given back to the voters.”
Elections in September saw Merkel’s bloc poll first place but with a reduced share of the vote and with the FDP and Greens as its only plausible coalition partners.
The collapse in the talks and possibility of fresh elections brings further uncertainty for the British government over Brexit, which had hoped that a strong German coalition, including the FDP, might help smooth the next phase of negotiations.
After a unusually constructive meeting last week with a Merkel ally, Manfred Weber, Theresa May, the British prime minister, was reported to be close to conceding to German demands for an increased divorce settlement in exchange for a favourable start to trade talks. The Brexit secretary, David Davis, also appealed directly to German business interests in Berlin on Friday.
However, the mooted moves come as the prospect of any future assistance from the German government recedes.
Prolonged uncertainty in Berlin will also raise concerns in France, where Emmanuel Macron was pinning hopes of eurozone reforms on partnership with a strong German government. “It is not in France’s interest for things to get blocked,” the French president said at the start of a meeting with Bernard Accoyer, a leader of France’s opposition Les Républicains party.
After a disappointing election result in September, Angela Merkel is struggling to build the political alliances she needs to gain a governing majority.
With many parties bruised by the experience of entering coalitions with Merkel’s party over the past twelve years, the German chancellor’s consensus-based approach seems to have reached a dead end.
But in Merkel's party, the notoriously disciplined Christian Democratic Union, rebels eager to topple the leader are in short supply. Nor has Merkel managed to groom a candidate with the credibility required to follow in her footsteps.
If there are fresh elections in 2018, it is not without question that the German chancellor could end up profiting from the acrimonious end to exploratory coalition talks and improve her share of the vote.
Steinmeier earlier appealed for German politicians to think of Europe as he called for coalition talks to resume. “There would be incomprehension and great concern inside and outside our country, and particularly in our European neighbourhood, if the political forces in the biggest and economically strongest country in Europe, of all places, didn’t fulfil their responsibility,” he said.
Going in to meet the president, Merkel said it was a “day of deep reflection on how to go forward” in Germany. “As chancellor, I will do everything to ensure that this country is well managed in the difficult weeks to come,” she told reporters.
Christian Democrat and Green negotiators on Monday stressed the common ground that had emerged between the two parties during the weeks of talks and focused their criticism on the FDP leader, Christian Lindner.
Lindner left the talks on Sunday saying the parties involved had missed several self-prescribed deadlines to resolve differences on migration and energy policies, and had “no common vision for modernisation of the country”.
“We continue to treat each other with respect and respect the [FDP’s] decision”, said Julia Klöckner, a CDU delegate. Kristina Schröder, a former Christian Democrat family minister, tweeted that the Free Democrats’ walk-out had “discredited” the possibility of a CDU-FDP minority government.
The veteran Green politician Jürgen Trittin prophesied that the pro-business party would have “a tough time” explaining its intransigence to voters seeking a responsible government in turbulent political times. Rather than taking the opportunity to make a difference on policies it cared about, such as phasing out the “solidarity surcharge” tax introduced to help fund German reunification, he said, the Free Democrats had “done a runner”.
Lindner defended his walkout, saying a continuation of the talks would have required his party to depart from its core policy convictions. “We wanted a political tide change, and that was not possible at this point,” he said.
The possibility of fresh elections in spring 2018 will continue to loom on the horizon in spite of the president’s appeal, however.
Germany’s constitution requires the president to nominate a chancellor for approval by the German parliament, the Bundestag. If no stable government can be formed after three rounds of voting there, the president would have to ask Germans to return to the polls.
The Social Democratic party, junior partner in a “grand coalition” with Merkel last term, on Monday ruled out talks about a similar arrangement for the next four years and signalled its appetite for a return to the polls.
“Two months after the federal elections the Christian Democratic Union, the Greens and the FDP have brought Germany into a difficult situation”, said the SPD leader, Martin Schulz. “We consider it important that citizens get the opportunity to consider the situation anew. We are not afraid of new elections.”
News of the collapsed talk was received with noticeable disappointment elsewhere in Europe."

Nearly two months after Germany’s general election, talks aimed at forming a three-party coalition between Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU), the Free Democratic party and the Greens have collapsed. The FDP walked out of a late-night round of negotiations on Sunday, saying it had been impossible to reach a compromise on migration and the environment. Unless the three-party deadlock is somehow ended, Germany could go one of three ways: Mrs Merkel might try to form a coalition with the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), which the SPD has ruled out; she might form a minority government, presumably with only one other party, which would be a new experience for postwar Germany; or, new elections might eventually be called.
This is an important moment. Each of these scenarios produces considerable political uncertainty in Europe’s powerhouse. The reverberations are sure to be felt not just in Germany itself, where the impact could be destabilising or could shock the country back together in some way. It is also certain to impact on the EU’s prospects of rebooting its project, at a time when the eurozone, security, migration, Vladimir Putin’s meddling, relations with Turkey, democratic backsliding in Poland and Hungary, and Brexit all need attending to. Monday’s nervous market reaction hinted at some of what is at stake.
More than anything else, the political crisis that has emerged in Germany marks Mrs Merkel’s eroded domestic influence after 12 years in power. That decline was brought about by the 2015 refugee crisis, which shook her chancellorship. She came out weakened from the 24 September election, with 33% of the votes. Although her party was the clear leader, voters for the first time gave six parties enough support to sit in the Bundestag. Conservative voters, particularly in the east, shifted in large numbers to the far-right Alternative für Deutschland, which gained nearly 13% of the vote, enough to give it 94 seats in the Bundestag.
New elections, if they are eventually triggered, could open up the possibility – sooner rather than later – of a post-Merkel Germany, as it would be unclear whether the chancellor could stay on. As the talks in Berlin started running into difficulties, there was speculation that Mrs Merkel’s CDU party might seek to replace her as leader, though if there were a new election the identity of her successor is extremely unclear. Mrs Merkel was tight-lipped on Sunday night, saying she’d hoped for a compromise but that she would now ensure “the country is well governed in the difficult weeks ahead”.
Germany’s political fragmentation reflects a wider phenomenon at work across much of Europe. Traditional parties have come under challenge from new groups both on the left and the right, with polarisation growing in the aftermath of the 2010-11 banking collapse and eurozone crisis. But each national political scene has its own specific traits. Germany’s talks were made more complex by the fact a three-way coalition had never been attempted before at national level. The FDP liberals, who had been all but wiped out politically after being Mrs Merkel’s junior partner from 2009 to 2013, wanted to make sure this time that they wouldn’t sell themselves short. Their leader, Christian Lindner, walked away on Sunday saying: “It is better not to govern than to govern badly.”
As she looks for partners, Mrs Merkel in theory still has the possibility of seeking to prolong the outgoing “grand coalition” with the SPD. But that would require party leaders to either do a U-turn from their September promise that the SPD would remain in opposition, or for them to be replaced by leaders who favoured a coalition with the Christian Democrats. Neither seems likely.
The unpredictable German political scene means that the EU will struggle even more to address its key issues. In France, Emmanuel Macron can no longer be certain of building a strong Franco-German “engine” with Mrs Merkel to drive eurozone governance reform (this was a sticking point for the FDP). Although Germany’s main parties see eye to eye on the Brexit negotiations, the political uncertainty will divert attention from UK withdrawal still further. German policies have often been controversial in Europe, but Mrs Merkel’s role in finding solutions – whether with Turkey on migration or on Russia sanctions over Ukraine – has frequently been decisive. The weekend failure in Berlin could be the start of very difficult times."

After exploratory talks to form Germany’s next government collapsed in dramatic fashion shortly before midnight on Sunday, the culprit was quickly found: Christian Lindner, the cocksure leader of the pro-business Free Democratic party (FDP) who had staged a well-orchestrated walkout, makes an all-too convincing villain of the piece.
But in the coming weeks German media will have to ask whether the real reason for the political paralysis in Europe’s biggest economy ultimately lies with another politician: Angela Merkel, the incumbent chancellor.
Merkel’s party colleagues and Green politicians had unanimously pointed their fingers at Lindner on Sunday night, insisting they had seen sufficient common ground for a compromise. Some of them voiced suspicions that the pro-business party had never really believed in their political enterprise in the first place.
Exactly which of his party’s red lines the coalition talks had overstepped, Lindner has been unable to convincingly explain. Green party co-leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt on Monday claimed that the FDP had called off the talks in spite of victories in key policy areas. In a country where political stability is valued as highly as it is in Germany, accusations of recklessness could haunt the traditional ally to Merkel’s CDU for years to come.
And yet the coalition talks of the last month have shown that a “Jamaica” coalition – so nicknamed because the colours of the Greens, the CDU and the FDP mirror those of the Jamaican flag – would likely have been an unstable one, filled with distrust and prone to imminent collapse. “It is better for a governing alliance to collapse before it has been forged than for it to drag itself through the legislative period in disharmony,” conservative broadsheet Frankfurt Allgemeine Zeitung opined on Monday morning.
The FDP’s petulance, and the Social Democrats’ unwillingness to open up talks about another “grand coalition” with the CDU, are directly linked to the Merkel question: both parties suffered existential setbacks after going into government with a chancellor who has become an expert at adopting and coopting other parties’ key policies.
“In the last few weeks, Merkel has been like the hinge of a door that opens to both sides of the political spectrum,” said Gero Neugebauer, a political scientist at Berlin’s Free University. “But that strategy hasn’t worked, and the debate about Lindner’s betrayal is already moving on to a debate about Merkel’s failure.”
It remains possible that moral outrage about the FDP walkout could form the emotional glue for a governing coalition between the CDU and the Greens, but this would be 42 seats short of a majority and have to rally support from other parties on a policy-by-policy basis: an unprecedented situation for a fresh government in post-war Germany.
But both a minority government or fresh elections will first involve the authority of Merkel’s chancellorship being tested in the Bundestag. To engineer a no-confidence vote that would trigger new polls, Merkel would first have to be formally voted in as Germany’s chancellor. If she fails to gain a sufficient majority, her loss of power will come even sharper into focus.
Yet even if there were to be new elections in spring next year it is possible that Merkel could run again. Seventeen years after she took charge of Germany’s conservative party, there are still no credible candidates for a coup at the top, nor candidates with her blessing that look ready to take over the helm. For now, the only party in Germany calling on Merkel to go is the far-right Alternative für Deutschland.
The end of Merkel may be closer than it has ever been. But when it comes, it will still be because she has decided to jump, rather than because she was pushed."

Within hours of watching Angela Merkel fail to form a coalition, Theresa May hosts a cabinet committee that will test the weakness of her own fragile government. After months of prevaricating, it seems Britain is finally ready to commit itself to paying a divorce settlement with the EU of anything up to a €60bn (£53bn) in a desperate attempt to unlock the next stage of Brexit talks on a trade deal and transition phase. Germany had led the hardball negotiating tactics that pushed May into this corner, but was expected to be – at least potentially – a more friendly ally when it came to discussing future free trade arrangements for its exporters. A weakened government in Berlin is less likely to be able win over more protectionist voices in the EU who have less to gain from an open border with Britain.

Germany is in uncharted territory. The collapse of the three-party coalition talks over a range of issues including immigration could mark the beginning of the end of Merkel’s political career after 12 years as chancellor. There are now three options: a minority government, which few parties favour; a “grand coalition” between her conservative CDU/CSU and the social democrat SPD party, which it has consistently ruled out; or new elections, which would require a vote in the Bundestag and risk being just as inconclusive as September’s vote. Whatever the outcome, Germany faces weeks, if not months, of paralysis, with a lame-duck, acting government unlikely to make major policy decisions at home or on the European stage – including on Brexit.
Brexiters have long argued that Germany, and in particular its big carmakers, will ensure Britain emerges with a favourable trade deal. But this flies in the face of EU logic and even German self-interest, as German industry leaders have endlessly repeated. If 7.5% of German exports go to Britain, 92.5% go elsewhere; for German manufacturers, the integrity of the single market outweighs a good deal with the UK. David Davis advised his audience in Berlin last week not to “put politics above prosperity” but Germany sees its prosperity as inseparable from the preservation of the single market. Since the EU referendum, German politicians have been warning Britain that it cannot cherry-pick: no one can enjoy the rewards of the single market without the compromises of membership.
Once more, Europe’s future is up in the air. The claim of Brexiters that the European project is doomed continue to look wildly overstated, but there is no doubt that Merkel’s weakness will delay the kind of far-reaching reforms mooted, for example, by France’s president, Emmanuel Macron.
More constructively, from a British perspective, the cause of her problems may at least rekindle debate about some of the EU’s existing strictures. Immigration means different things to German and British voters, but both Merkel and the pre-Brexit UK government were tainted by the perception they had allowed it to run out of control.
The challenge of ensuring there is no room for the far right in the event of new elections may perhaps win fractionally more sympathy for Britain’s aim to curb European free movement. But imagining Germany will ride to the rescue with a cake-and-eat-it trade deal remains almost as implausible as thinking BMW will override 40 years of EU law."

The British political class, like much of the British media, remains foolishly obsessed with America to the exclusion of all other foreign countries. As a result, both refuse to pay consistent attention to German politics, or indeed to the internal politics of any other European country at all. So the news that Angela Merkel may not, after all, continue in office as Germany’s chancellor will have come as a rude shock to many of them.
The British have always blithely assumed that Merkel would somehow ride to the UK’s rescue over Brexit like the Prussians at the battle of Waterloo. David Cameron thought this would happen in the negotiations preceding the referendum in 2015-16. Now Theresa May, and certainly David Davis, seem to have a similar hope over Brexit. It is a foolish error.
Like most German politicians, Merkel is not actively anti-British in any way. She would certainly welcome a Britain that was a committed ally in Europe. But that’s not the Britain that is on offer, the more’s the pity.
The truth has always been that Merkel has more pressing priorities at home than Brexit, and more reliable allies in Europe than Britain. Now that coalition talks between Merkel’s CDU-CSU Christian Democrats, the free market liberal FDP and the Greens have broken down, however, the prospect that Merkel may not even be there as the Brexit talks reach their climax is a real one.
Merkel will still be chancellor when Theresa May goes to Brussels on 14 December for the EU summit that must decide if “sufficient progress” has been made in the Brexit talks. So she will still matter. But the idea that Merkel will or could somehow magic an 11th-hour solution favourable to Britain is simply for the birds. It misunderstands – as too many in the Conservative party do, taking their cue from the insouciant Davis – the nature of the process that is supposed to be taking place.
In these Brexit talks, Germany has the influence that comes from being Europe’s most important country, but the process within which it is exercised is essentially a legal one, laid down by treaty. The British have never understood that they are the appellant not the defendant in the Brexit talks: it’s Britain that wants to leave, so the UK, not the EU, has to make the big moves towards compromise deals.
But this error is compounded by another: the conviction that Germany will go significantly out of its way to help Brexit Britain. Germany’s overriding concern is that the EU must survive, cohere and strengthen in the face of testing events. The big impact on the European level of the coalition talks breakdown is that it sets back Emmanuel Macron’s hopes of persuading Germany to reform eurozone priorities and structures.
Neither France nor Germany has any long-term political interest in assisting Britain to make a favourable bespoke deal that could become both a precedent and a catalyst towards divergence within the EU. As German business leaders told Davis in Berlin last week, they want Britain to make the moves that matter, not to be offered a special deal that suits Eurosceptics.
In any case, Brexit is largely irrelevant to the coalition talks in Berlin. A senior German official recently told me that Brexit was about the eighth or ninth issue on Merkel’s to-do list in foreign affairs, never mind the domestic politics that are any leader’s inevitable priority. As an illustration, the issues that matter in the talks that have just failed were: first, migration policy; second, the future of coal; and third, financial transfers from the regions of the former West Germany to those of the former East Germany.
Germany is a stable country with built-in constitutional safeguards that derive from the determination to avoid the instabilities of the past. In Britain the failure of talks would create a frantic domestic political crisis that would have to solved by next weekend at the latest. Germany has weeks and months to sort out whether it can form a government. During this time Merkel will remain in charge.
But Germany is in a political territory without maps. It has no postwar tradition of minority governments. Yet there are now six parties in the Bundestag, which has the effect that coalitions are even more inevitable than in the past, for all their difficulty. It is not impossible that some in the opposition Social Democratic party will be open to overtures to rethink the party’s refusal to continue in government under Merkel. But that looks a long shot.
The great unknown in future elections is whether Germans decide they have looked over the precipice of a six-party Bundestag, have seen the ultra-right Alternative für Deutschland in parliament, and will now turn once more to Merkel and the Christian Democrats as the best guarantee of stability.
The immediate effect of the break-up of talks will be to weaken the FDP, which is taking the blame for the failure. But the longer-term issue is whether Merkel can restore the Christian Democrats at the heart of German politics. Compared with that, Brexit looks a distinctly second-order priority.
